### Defintion: 

Pooling is a down-sampling operation that reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps, while keeping the important information. This reduces the computational complexity of our model, by reducing the number of parameters to learn, and also helps to prevent overfitting.

### How it Works: 

The pooling layer operates independently on every depth slice of the input. It slides a window (also known as the "pooling window") across the input and applies a specific operation. The size of this sliding window is a hyperparameter of the pooling layer.

There are several types of pooling operations:

1.  **Max Pooling:** This is the most commonly used pooling method. The operation applied is the maximum operation, which outputs the maximum value in the pooling window. This means that only the maximum value within that window survives, while the other values are discarded.
    
2.  **Average Pooling:** This operation computes the average value of all the numbers in the pooling window. This means that all values contribute equally to the final output.
    
3.  **Min Pooling:** This operation, less commonly used, computes the minimum value of all the numbers in the pooling window.
    

### Why use Pooling? 

1.  **Dimensionality Reduction:** Pooling helps reduce the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the input volume. This reduction translates to less computational cost and less overfitting.
    
2.  **Invariance to Small Translations:** One interesting property of pooling is that it provides a form of translation invariance. That is, if we translate the input by a small amount, the values of most of the pooled outputs do not change.
    

**Stride and Padding in Pooling:**

Like in convolutional layers, pooling operations include the concepts of stride and padding:

-   **Stride:** This is the step size that we move the pooling window each time we slide it across the input volume. A larger stride results in a smaller output size.
    
-   **Padding:** This is rarely used in pooling layers, but it could be used to control the spatial sizes of the output volumes.


### Difference Between Pooling Layers and Hidden Layers: 

In the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a hidden layer generally refers to any layer that is not an input or output layer. Both convolutional layers and pooling layers can be considered hidden layers, but they perform different functions in the network.

**Convolutional Layers:**

Convolutional layers are the main building blocks of CNNs. These layers apply a set of learnable filters (kernels) to the input. Each filter is convolved across the width and height of the input volume and computes dot products between the entries of the filter and the input, producing a 2-dimensional activation map. These activation maps stack together to form the output volume of the convolutional layer. Convolutional layers are where the network learns to detect local conjunctions of features from the previous layer.

**Pooling Layers:**

Pooling layers, on the other hand, perform a down-sampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height) of the input volume. The primary function of pooling layers is to progressively reduce the spatial size of the input volume, which reduces the number of parameters and computation in the network, thereby controlling overfitting. Pooling layers work independently on every depth slice of the input and reduce its size. The most common type is a max pooling layer, but there are also other types like average pooling and L2-norm pooling.

In summary, while both convolutional layers and pooling layers are considered hidden layers in a CNN, they perform very different functions. Convolutional layers are used to learn features from the input data, while pooling layers are used to reduce the dimensionality of the input, helping to make the network more computationally efficient and robust to overfitting.

### Pooling vs Compression: 

Pooling serves to compress or reduce the spatial dimensionality of the input data (feature maps). This is similar to how compression algorithms reduce the size of files.

However, unlike many compression methods, which try to preserve as much of the original data as possible, pooling is a lossy operation. For instance, in the case of max pooling, only the maximum value within a certain region is preserved, while all other values are discarded. This lossy nature is actually beneficial in this context, as it not only reduces the computational load, but also introduces a level of robustness and invariance to minor changes or shifts in the input.

So, while the goal of pooling isn't exactly the same as file compression, the concept of reducing data size is similar. It's important to note though that the compression in pooling isn't designed to be reversed (or decompressed), which is typically a key aspect of data compression algorithms.

### Takeaway: 

Overall, pooling layers serve a crucial role in CNN architectures, aiding in reducing computational cost and controlling overfitting, while maintaining the significant features necessary for the task.
