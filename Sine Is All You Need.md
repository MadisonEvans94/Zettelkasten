# Sine is all you need 

## Intro 
- intro hook 

## What Can the Fourier Transform Tell Us? 

- define fourier transform 
- vibrating systems in nature 
- explaining the frequency spectrum with an analogy to visual 

## Generating Harmonics: Saturation under the hood 
- introduction to saturation curves 
	- non linear process
	- odd vs even (symmetric vs asymmetric)
	- pure tones and how they aren't present in nature 
- visual analogy: color saturation and finding the perfect color balance 

## A Psychoacoustics Perspective 
- human ears and the chart that shows how we perceive sound 
- which harmonics are melodic vs dissonant, and when might a strategy be preferred. 
- contrast in frequency and how that might affect our attention  


## Tying it back to mixing 
- where do instruments sit in a mix 
- how does saturation both compress the dynamics of a sound and why added bass harmonics can be good in certain instrument combinations (sometimes saturation makes things to messy and it comes down to arrangement)
- intermodulation and why adding saturation to a pure tone sine wave is more akin to working off a blank canvas
