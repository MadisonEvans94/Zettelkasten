### Cloud Computing

**Cloud Computing:**
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, artificial intelligence, and more—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. 

**Types of Cloud Services:**
1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** This type of cloud computing provides the infrastructure such as virtual machines and other resources like virtual-machine disk image library, block and file-based storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks etc. See [[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]] for more

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** This service is used in developing, testing and maintaining of software. PaaS is same as IaaS but also provides the additional tools like database management systems, business intelligence (BI) services, development tools etc. See [[Platform as a Service (PaaS)]] for more

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):** In this service model, the cloud-based applications are provided to the user, as a service on demand. It is a single instance of the service running on the cloud and multiple end users are serviced. See [[Software as a Service (SaaS)]] for more

**Public vs Private vs Hybrid Clouds:**
1. **Public Clouds:** Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers, who deliver their computing resources such as servers and storage over the Internet. [[AWS]] is an example of a public cloud.

2. **Private Clouds:** A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization’s on-site datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.

3. **Hybrid Clouds:** Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them.

**Advantages of Cloud Computing:**
- Cost Effective
- Almost Unlimited Storage
- Backup and Recovery
- Automatic Software Integration
- Easy Access to Information
- Quick Deployment

### Distributed systems

**Distributed Systems:**
A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system. In a distributed system, computers, which are often referred to as nodes, work together and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another. [[CAP Theorem]] is an important foundational principle that is understood when designing these systems. 

**Characteristics of Distributed Systems:**
- **Concurrency of Components:** Multiple events can occur concurrently in different parts of a distributed system. 
- **Lack of a Global Clock:** It's difficult to have a single accurate time across all nodes of a distributed system.
- **Independent Failure of Components:** Failures in one part of the system do not affect operation of other parts of the system.

**Advantages of Distributed Systems:**
- **Resource Sharing:** Resources like printers, files, web pages, databases, etc. can be shared by all users or processes.
- **Speedup the Computation:** A large computation can be divided into smaller tasks that can be processed concurrently on different nodes.
- **Increase the Reliability:** If one site fails in a distributed system, the remaining sites can potentially continue operating.
- **Easier Expansion:** In distributed systems, we can easily add more resources to the system as demand increases.
