## `req`: 

Let's say you have an `Express.js` server running and it receives a POST request at the endpoint `/api/users`, with the body content `{ "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" }`.

This is how the `req` object might look like:

```javascript
{
  method: 'POST',
  url: '/api/users',
  headers: {
    'content-type': 'application/json',
    'user-agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.198 Safari/537.36',
    accept: '*/*',
    'accept-encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br',
    connection: 'keep-alive'
  },
  body: {
    name: 'Alice',
    email: 'alice@example.com'
  },
  params: {},
  query: {},
  path: '/api/users',
  protocol: 'http',
  host: 'localhost:3000'
}
```

**A breakdown of some of the key parts:**

### `method`
The HTTP method of the request, in this case `POST`.

### `url`
The path of the URL which was requested, in this case '`/api/users`'.

### `headers`
Contains key-value pairs of the HTTP headers that were sent with the request.

### `body`
This property is not available by default with `Express.js`. It's populated when you use body-parsing middleware like `express.json()` or `express.urlencoded()`. It contains the data sent by the client.

### `params`
Contains route parameters (if any).

### `query`
Contains the URL query parameters (if any).

### `path`
The path section of the URL, which comes after the host and before the query, including the initial slash if present. In this case '/api/users'

### `protocol`
The protocol used to make the request, in this case 'http'.

### `host`
The host (domain name or IP address) and optionally the port number of the URL.

*This is a simplified representation and not all properties are included here. There are more properties and methods available in the `req` object which can be found in the [docs](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req).*

## `res`: 

The `res` (response) object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.

Let's assume that in response to the above request, your `Express.js` server is sending a JSON object back to the client with the newly created user:

```javascript
const newUser = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@example.com'
};

res.status(201).json(newUser);
```

The `res` object in this case does not simply represent the response being sent back to the client, **but also** contains a multitude of properties and methods to configure what is sent. Keep in mind, in most cases you will need to use the `.json` method for your response. 

**Some of these include:**

### `res.body`
Represents the response body. Unlike `req.body`, `res.body` is not populated by default, but can be populated when you use methods like `res.json()`.

### `res.headersSent`
A Boolean that indicates if the app sent HTTP headers for the response.

### `res.statusCode`
The HTTP status code of the response.

*However*, it's important to note that the `res` object isn't typically viewed as a whole, unlike `req`. Instead, you use its methods to construct and send your HTTP response. 

*For example*, `res.status(201).json(newUser)` sets the status code to 201 (Created) and sends a JSON response body. This doesn't result in a "response object" that you can log out or view in your server-side code.

If you're interested in viewing the actual HTTP response (including headers, status code, body, etc.) that is sent to the client, you would need to look at the client-side where the request was made, or use a tool to intercept HTTP requests and responses such as **Postman** or the **Network tab** in your browser's developer tools.

## `next`:

The `next` function is a part of the middleware function signature in `Express.js`. It is used to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack. If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function; otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

The `next` function is typically used when the current middleware function cannot end the request-response cycle, or when it should not be the one to end it. 

Consider this simple example:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now())
  next()
})
```

In this case, the middleware function simply logs the current time to the console, then passes control to the next middleware function in the stack by calling `next()`.

You can also use the `next` function to pass errors to Express. If you pass anything to the `next` function (except the string 'route'), Express will regard the current request as being in error and will skip any remaining non-error handling routing and middleware functions.

Example:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.user) {
     next(new Error('User not found'));
  } else {
     next();
  }
});
```

In this case, if `req.user` is not defined, an error is passed to `next` and Express will skip any remaining non-error handling routing and middleware functions.

The `next` function accepts an optional argument. Here's what it can be:

### `next()`
Moves to the next middleware.

### `next('route')`
Moves to the next route handler (skipping remaining middleware in the current stack).

### `next(new Error('message'))` or `next('error message')`
Passes an error down the chain until an error handling middleware handles it.

Note: If you pass anything to the `next()` function, Express will consider it an error.

It is crucial to understand the `next` function when working with Express.js, as it is a fundamental part of how middleware operates.
