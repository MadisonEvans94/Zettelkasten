## What Is a Domain Name Server (DNS)?

A Domain Name Server, or DNS, is a server that contains a database of public IP addresses along with their associated hostnames. This is used to translate domain names that are easy for people to remember into IP addresses, which are used by machines for communication on a network.

## DNS in the HTTP/HTTPS Request Lifecycle

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of where DNS fits into the HTTP/HTTPS request lifecycle:

### 1. Client sends a DNS query: 
When you type a URL into your browser, it sends a DNS query to your **[[Internet Service Provider (ISP)]]**. 

### 2. ISP processes the DNS query: 
The ISP's DNS server looks for the IP address associated with the requested domain. If it's in its cache (recently accessed domains are usually stored there for a while), it will return it. If not, the request goes to other DNS servers until it finds the right IP address.

### 3. Client sends HTTP/HTTPS request: 
Once your browser knows the IP address of the server hosting the website you want to visit, it sends an HTTP or HTTPS request to that server.

### 4. Server responds: 
The server sends back the requested web page, which your browser then renders for you to view.

## Under the Hood: How Does DNS Work?

When a DNS server receives a request, it first checks its own records to see if it can resolve the request from its cache. If not, it goes through a four-step process:

### 1. Recursive query to root server: 
The root server doesnâ€™t know the address, but it can direct our query to a server that knows more about the top-level domain (TLD, e.g., .com, .org, .net).

### 2. Referral to TLD server: 
**TLD servers** maintain information for all the domain names with a specific extension, such as .com or .org. The TLD server for our query will direct us to the **authoritative server** for the domain.

### 3. Ask the authoritative server: 
The authoritative server knows the IP address associated with the domain name.

### 4. Retrieve the record: 
The authoritative DNS server checks its records for the requested domain and returns the corresponding IP address.

## Explain it Like I'm 12: DNS Explained

Imagine you're at home, and you want to call your friend Billy. You don't remember Billy's phone number, but you remember his name. So you check your phonebook where all your friends' names are matched with their phone numbers. You look for "Billy," and next to his name, you find his number. Now, you can call him!

That's how DNS works, but instead of phone numbers, we're talking about IP addresses of websites. When you type in "www.google.com," your computer doesn't know what that is. It needs the "phone number" (IP address) for Google. The DNS is like the phonebook. It looks up "www.google.com" and finds the IP address that your computer can call to get the website. Just like how you could call Billy once you knew his phone number.

the original analogy is a high-level simplification that helps understand the basic concept of DNS. However, it doesn't cover more specific components like CNAME, AWS Route 53, SSL certificates, or domain registrars like Google Domains. Let's enrich the analogy to address those:

1. **CNAME (Canonical Name)**: Suppose Billy's phone number is also associated with his parents' house. Billy's parents' house can be seen as the "CNAME". So, when you look up Billy's name in the phone book, instead of giving you a phone number directly, it tells you to look up "Billy's Parents' House" (the alias) which then leads you to the actual phone number (the canonical name). 
> see [[What is a CNAME?]] for more context

3. **AWS Route 53**: In this analogy, AWS Route 53 acts as the phone company that manages the phone book. It organizes all the names and numbers, making sure that when you look up "Billy" or "Billy's Parents' House", you get the right number. It also ensures that the number is updated if Billy's family changes their phone number or moves to a new house.

4. **SSL certificate**: When you call Billy, you might want to make sure you're really talking to Billy and not an imposter. An SSL certificate in this context could be a secret handshake or a codeword that only you and Billy know. When you call and Billy uses the codeword, you know you've reached the right person. In the same way, SSL certificates encrypt data and authenticate the identity of websites, ensuring that your connection to the site is secure and you're really talking to the site you think you are.

5. **Google Domains vs AWS Route 53**: Let's consider Google Domains and AWS Route 53 as two different phone companies. They both can provide the phone book service, but they might have different ways of managing it, different additional services, or different pricing models. For example, Google Domains is a domain registrar service (it can officially assign you the "name" you want to use), while AWS Route 53 is both a domain registrar and a DNS service provider (it can assign you the name and also manage the phone book).


This analogy aims to provide a more intuitive understanding of these concepts, but keep in mind that it simplifies many technical details.
