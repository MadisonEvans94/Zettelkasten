### Important Kera Objects within Tensorflow: 

```python
from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models
```

*but what does keras even stand for?*
**Keras** is a high-level neural networks API, capable of running on top of various lower-level frameworks like TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. The name "Keras" is derived from the Greek word "κέρας" meaning "horn". It was chosen because it is a symbol of the Cretan bull, as well as the mythological minotaur creature.

*why was keras developed?*
The Keras library was developed with a focus on user-friendliness, modularity, and extensibility, and is designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks.

As of TensorFlow version 1.5, Keras has been included in TensorFlow as its official high-level API, allowing you to define and train complex models in just a few lines of code. Despite being part of TensorFlow, the Keras API provides a more user-friendly and easy-to-use interface for building and training models, which makes it a great choice for beginners and researchers alike.
