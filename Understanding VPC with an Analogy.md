Let's imagine the internet as a **big city**

## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Think of a VPC like your private neighborhood in a bustling city. The neighborhood is a secured area that is separated from the rest of the city. It has houses, playgrounds, swimming pools, and even shops. This is your private space in the vast city, and only people who live there (or those who are specifically invited) can enter.

## Subnets
Now, within your neighborhood (VPC), there are different blocks, and these blocks are like subnets. Each block (subnet) has a range of houses. Some blocks might be reserved only for houses (private subnets), and others might have shops that anyone from the city (Internet) can visit, as long as they know the address and the shops are open (public subnets).

## Security Groups
Every house in the neighborhood has a set of rules about who can enter or exit, like a parent saying, "only friends from school can come in", or "only the pizza delivery guy can come to the door". That's what a security group is - it's like the rule-set that decides who can knock on your door (incoming traffic) and where the residents can go (outgoing traffic).

## Internet 
The entire city, full of different neighborhoods, public buildings, parks, and roads connecting them, is like the Internet. It's publicly accessible and anyone can travel around the city, visit different neighborhoods (if they are open to public), or stop by at shops (public servers). But not all roads lead everywhere. Some roads might be private or have tolls or checkpoints (firewalls and routers) that only let certain cars (data packets) through.

## Access Points (in terms of Amazon EFS)
Back to our neighborhood, let's think about access points as special entrances to a shared community center. Each entrance could be designed for a specific group of people. For instance, there could be a door for adults that leads to a reading room, and a separate entrance for kids that goes directly to a playroom. Each access point (entrance) is regulated, allowing specific access to parts of the community center (file system) and ensuring users can only access the areas (data) they're supposed to.
