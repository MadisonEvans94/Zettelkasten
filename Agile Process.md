the 12 agile principles 


1. Deliver Value Faster – Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. 

2. Welcome Change – Welcome changes to requirements, even late in projects. Agile processes harness that change for the customer’s competitive advantage. 

3. Deliver Working Software Frequently – Working software should be delivered after a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. 

4. Work Together Daily – Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 

5. Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals – Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done. 

6. Face-to-Face Conversations – The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is with face-to-face conversation. 

7. Working Software is Key – Working software is the primary measure of progress. 

8. Sustainable Development – Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, project team members (developers), and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 

9. Attention to Technical Excellence – Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 

10. Simplicity – The art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential. 

11. Self-Organizing Teams – The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from selforganizing teams. 

Reflect and Adjust – At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
