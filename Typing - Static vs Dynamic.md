###### Upstream: [[Software Development]]
###### Siblings: [[Typing - Weak vs Strong]]

### What
- In a statically typed language, the variable type is checked at compile-time
- In dynamically typed language, the variable type is checked at run-time

### Tradeoffs
- Statically Typed
	- Pros
		- Errors can be caught early at compilation 
		- debugging is easier 
		- code is more understandable and easier to maintain 
	- Cons
		- Less flexible, since the variable cannot be changed once declared
		- More manual energy required by the programmer
- Dynamically Typed 
	- Pros
		- More flexibility, you can change the type at any time 
		- Easier for beginners and less technical backgrounds 
	- Cons
		- Errors not revealed until runtime
		- Less ideal for large code bases where bugs could remain hidden
