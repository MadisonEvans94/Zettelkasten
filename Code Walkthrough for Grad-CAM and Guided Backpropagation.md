# Brain Dump: 


Alright, so imagine you've got this list of numbers, right? Some are chill positive vibes, and some are buzzkill negatives. You wanna keep the good vibes and ditch the bad ones. This line of code is your cosmic filter for that.

1. `torch.zeros(x.size())`: This is like an empty cup; it's got nothing in it but is ready to hold some cosmic juice. It's the same shape as your list, `x`.
  
2. `(x > 0).type_as(x)`: Now, this is like a magical sieve. It goes through your list, `x`, and wherever it finds a positive number, it marks that spot with a 1. If it's zero or negative, it marks it with a 0. Then it turns these 1s and 0s into the same data type as `x`, so they can mingle without any cosmic misunderstandings.

3. `torch.addcmul(torch.zeros(x.size()), x, (x > 0).type_as(x))`: Alright, now it's party time. You've got your empty cup and your magic sieve. `addcmul` multiplies each number in `x` with its corresponding 1 or 0 from the sieve. So, the good vibes (positive numbers) get multiplied by 1 (stay the same), and the buzzkills (zero and negatives) get multiplied by 0 (turn to zero).

The result? You've got a new list, `output`, with all the good vibes kept and all the bad vibes turned to zero. And that's what this line is doing, man.

## Import Libraries
```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Function as TorchFunc
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
```

## Custom ReLU for Guided Backpropagation
```python
class CustomReLU(TorchFunc):
    ...
```

This class provides a custom ReLU activation function tailored for guided backpropagation.

## GradCam Class
```python
class GradCam:
    ...
```

### Guided Backpropagation Method

> Important Note: 
> Guided Backpropagation zeroes out the negative gradients, effectively acting as a filter that only lets the positive influencers contribute to the final output. This has the effect of enhancing the contrast in the backpropagated gradients, which can be especially helpful when you're trying to visualize them.
>
>In the context of visualizations like GradCam, this makes the regions of interest "pop" more. By combining this with GradCam, which already provides a spatial heatmap of important regions, you can get a more visually compelling and insightful heatmap. The high activations will tend to be brighter, and the unimportant regions will be darker, making it easier to interpret what the neural network is focusing on.

#### Ensure Gradients for Backpropagation
```python
for param in gc_model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True
```

#### Replace Standard ReLU with Custom ReLU

```python
for idx, module in gc_model.features._modules.items():
    ...
```

Step 1: **Forward Pass** - Done implicitly when calling `gc_model(X_tensor)`.

Step 2: **Score Derivation** 
```python
scores = gc_model(X_tensor)
y_tensor = y_tensor.view(-1, 1)
scores = scores.gather(1, y_tensor).squeeze()
```
>Alright, man, picture this: You've got this tray of cosmic brownies—each one a different flavor, or "class" if you wanna get technical. That's your `scores`. Now, you've also got this list of your favorite flavors, like a VIP list for a party. That's your `y_tensor`.
>
So, what you wanna do is pick out just the brownies that match your VIP list. The `.gather(1, y_tensor)` part is like your bouncer at the door, only letting in the brownies that are on the list. It goes through `scores` and picks out the scores corresponding to the classes in `y_tensor`. 
>
Now, the `.squeeze()` part is like telling everyone to get cozy. If your VIP list had extra dimensions like a 3D guest list for a multi-level party, `.squeeze()` flattens it down. It removes dimensions that are just size 1, so your list is as simple and chill as possible.
>
So, `scores = scores.gather(1, y_tensor).squeeze()` is all about keeping the party exclusive to your fave brownies and making sure everyone's comfortable in a simpler space. Cool, huh?

Step 3: **Backward Pass**
```python
scores.backward(torch.ones_like(scores), retain_graph=True)
```

##### Important note: 

The forward pass serves two key roles in Grad-CAM:

1. **Activation Maps**: It populates the activation maps at the layer we are interested in. These activation maps serve as the basis for the Grad-CAM heatmaps. Without doing a forward pass, these wouldn't be populated.

2. **Class Selection**: The forward pass computes the scores for all the classes. The `.gather()` operation then selects the score for the class we are interested in. This step essentially "marks" the specific output neuron whose gradients we want to compute during the backward pass. Even though we pass in ones for the gradients, we've already selected the specific class score that those ones correspond to.

When you call `.backward()`, you're computing how much a small change in each feature map would affect that specific class score. This is essentially what the gradients represent. It's not that the specific scores themselves are being used in the `.backward()` computation directly. Rather, the forward pass sets up the state of the network so that you can compute those gradients.

The "ones" are used to initiate the chain of gradient computations for that specific class back through the network. The value "1" implies that we're interested in a unit change in the selected class score and want to find out how each feature map would contribute to that unit change. This is in line with the typical interpretation of gradients as representing change—if the output were to increase by 1 unit, how much would each input need to change?

So, while it might seem like the scores are not being "used," the forward pass serves to set up everything correctly so that the backward pass gives you meaningful gradients for the class you're interested in.

#### Extract and Process Gradients
```python
guided_gradients = X_tensor.grad.cpu().data.numpy()
guided_gradients = np.transpose(guided_gradients, (0, 2, 3, 1))
```

### GradCam Method

#### Define Hooks for Gradients and Activations
```python
def gradient_hook(a, b, gradient):
    self.gradient_value = gradient[0]

def activation_hook(a, b, activation):
    self.activation_value = activation
```

#### Register Hooks
```python
conv_module.register_forward_hook(activation_hook)
conv_module.register_backward_hook(gradient_hook)
```

Step 1: **Forward Pass** - Implicit in `scores = gc_model(X_tensor)`.

Step 2: **Score Derivation**
```python
scores = gc_model(X_tensor)
y_tensor = y_tensor.view(-1, 1)
scores = scores.gather(1, y_tensor).squeeze()
```

Step 3: **Backward Pass**
```python
scores.backward(torch.ones_like(scores), retain_graph=True)
```

Step 4: **Global Average Pooling**
```python
pooled_gradients = torch.mean(gradients, dim=[2, 3], keepdim=True)
```

Step 5: **Compute the Weighted Sum**
```python
cam = torch.sum(pooled_gradients * activations, dim=1, keepdim=True)
```

Step 6: **ReLU Activation**
```python
cam = torch.nn.functional.relu(cam)
```

Step 7: **Rescaling and Upsampling**
```python
cam = cam.cpu().detach().numpy()
cam = np.squeeze(cam)
cam_scaled = ...
cam = np.array(cam_scaled)
cam -= np.min(cam)
cam /= np.max(cam)
```
