## 1. AlexNet

**Year:** 2012  
**Key Reference:** Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks.

### Overview:
- AlexNet is the architecture that truly brought deep learning to the forefront. It significantly outperformed traditional machine learning models in the 2012 ImageNet competition.
- It contains 5 convolutional layers followed by 3 fully connected layers.

### Key Features:
- **ReLU Activation:** AlexNet popularized the use of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function.
- **Dropout:** To prevent overfitting, dropout was implemented in the fully connected layers.
- **Data Augmentation:** Random cropping, flipping, and RGB color shifts were used to expand the dataset and reduce overfitting.
- **Local Response Normalization (LRN):** Used after the first and second pooling layers. However, LRN is not widely used in more recent architectures.

## 2. VGGNet

**Year:** 2014  
**Key Reference:** Simonyan, K., & Zisserman, A. (2014). Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition.

### Overview:
- VGGNet is known for its simplicity and depth. It demonstrated that depth (number of layers) in a network is a critical component for good performance.
- Two main variants exist: VGG-16 (16 weight layers) and VGG-19 (19 weight layers).

### Key Features:
- **Uniform Architecture:** Uses only 3x3 convolutional layers stacked on top of each other in increasing depth.
- **ReLU Activation:** Like AlexNet, it employs the ReLU activation function.
- **No Fancy Tricks:** Does not use other fancy techniques, but relies on depth.

## 3. Inception Net (GoogLeNet)

**Year:** 2014  
**Key Reference:** Szegedy, C., et al. (2014). Going deeper with convolutions.

### Overview:
- GoogLeNet introduced the Inception module, a novel way to allow the network to make its own decisions on the type of convolution or pooling to perform.
- Uses 9 inception modules stacked linearly, making the network very deep.

### Key Features:
- **Inception Module:** Contains multiple filter types in the same level, including 1x1, 3x3, 5x5 convolutions and 3x3 pooling. They are concatenated at the end of the module.
- **1x1 Convolutions:** Used to reduce the number of features, making the computations more efficient.
- **No Fully Connected Layers:** Uses average pooling at the end, leading to a reduction in the total number of parameters.

## 4. ResNet

**Year:** 2015  
**Key Reference:** He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., & Sun, J. (2015). Deep residual learning for image recognition.

### Overview:
- ResNet addresses the problem of vanishing gradients by introducing skip (or residual) connections.
- Variants include ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152, where the numbers indicate layers.

### Key Features:
- **Residual Block:** Contains skip connections that bypass one or more layers.
- **Batch Normalization:** Used after every layer.
- **ReLU Activation:** Used after each batch normalization.
- **Handles Very Deep Networks:** Even 100+ layers deep networks can be trained, which was a challenge before ResNet.
