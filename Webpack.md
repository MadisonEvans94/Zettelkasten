### What: 

Web bundlers are tools that take all of our javascript, html, and css and combines them intelligently into trasnportable files 

### Why: 

optimization and avoiding version conflicts and dependency conflicts by kinda compiling everything before deploying 

### Musings: 

...

first npm install webpack. Then use a script in the package json file that calls "webpack". Webpack will analyze index.js. `npm run build`. Compiles to a main.js file within ./dist directory (which gets created when `npm run build` is ran)

### Ideas:


files folders and code
`npm run build`
`index.js`
