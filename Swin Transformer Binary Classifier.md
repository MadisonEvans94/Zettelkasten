First we need to establish baseline model performance by fine tuning swin transformer as a binary classifier. (if there's enough time and resources, we can do transfer learning and fine tuning to compare and contrast). This is crucial because it provides a reference point against which we can measure the impact of any modifications or augmentations.. We already have access to a pretrained Swin Transformer module in pytorch; this can be seen in the [jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jNCaFkBiTaylSZqTZOnnYP3o_alrhpaD?usp=sharing) that I've set up for this project Then perhaps we can investigate one of the following options: 
  
- Augment the data by convert ingthe images to frequency domain and pass through the swin transformer, training it as binary classifier via transfer learning and/or fine tuning 
- Augment the data by doing fourier transform and concatenating the frequency output with the input image (this would increase the complexity by adding additional channels)
- Parallel process that has one stream analyze the normal input and one analyzing the frequency input, and have these merged later in the architecture 

The following are some additional thoughts I have on each of these... 

### Frequency Domain Augmentation

- Direct Frequency Domain Training: Converting images to the frequency domain and training the Swin Transformer directly on this representation is an innovative approach. It will be interesting to see how well the Transformer architecture, primarily developed for spatial domain analysis, adapts to frequency domain data.
- Challenges: Consider the representation of frequency domain data (e.g., amplitude and phase components) and how to scale or normalize this information for effective learning.

### Concatenating Frequency Output with Input Image

- Complexity Increase: Acknowledging the increased complexity due to additional channels is important. This approach will require more memory and computational power.
- Data Representation: Ensure that the concatenated data (spatial and frequency domain) is presented to the model in a way that enables effective learning. This might involve experimentation with how the channels are ordered or normalized.

### Parallel Processing Streams

- Innovative Fusion: The idea of having parallel streams (one for normal input and one for frequency domain input) is quite innovative and aligns with some recent trends in multi-modal learning.
- Integration Point: Deciding where and how to merge these streams will be crucial. Options include merging before the classification head or earlier in the architecture. Each choice has implications for how the model learns to integrate these different types of information.

### Additional Considerations

- Resource Allocation: Be mindful of the resources (time, computational power) required for each experiment. Prioritize based on feasibility and potential impact.
- Evaluation Metrics: Ensure you have clear evaluation metrics to compare the performance of different models and approaches.
- Iterative Approach: Given the experimental nature of some approaches, be prepared to iterate and refine based on initial results.
