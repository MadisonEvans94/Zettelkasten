[How many hidden layers and neurons do you need in your artificial neural network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqBRET7tbiQ&t=80s&ab_channel=DigitalSreeni)

### Underlying Question: 

*how do I know how many layers I should put in my convolutional neural network architecture? Let's say I'm doing image classification with 2 possible outputs, and the image is a 100x100 pixel image. How do I determine the amount of hidden layers, whether or not I use pooling layers and how many, and whether or not to make it densely connected or sparse?* 

### Solution/Reasoning: 

The architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN) can significantly affect its performance, and choosing the right architecture involves a lot of experimental tuning. Here are some general guidelines to help you make your decisions:

1.  **Number of Layers:** The depth of a CNN is a crucial design choice. Deeper networks can represent more complex features, but they also require more training data and are more prone to overfitting. You may want to start with a smaller network and gradually add layers until the validation accuracy starts to decline.
    
2.  **Pooling Layers:** Pooling layers are typically used to reduce the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the input volume. This reduction helps to control overfitting and reduces the computational complexity. Common practice is to use a pooling layer after every one or two convolutional layers.
    
3.  **Densely Connected or Sparse:** The decision to use dense or sparse connections often depends on the specific problem and data you have. Dense connections can model more complex interactions but might be prone to overfitting and demand more computational resources. In contrast, sparse connections limit the interaction between neurons to a local region, which can help with generalization and reduce computational costs. It's common to use dense connections (fully connected layers) towards the end of the network.
    
4.  **Transfer Learning:** If your dataset is small, one common and effective approach is to use a pre-trained CNN as a feature extractor and only train a small number of layers on top of it. Pre-trained networks such as VGG16, ResNet, or EfficientNet have already learned a rich set of features from large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet), and these features can be useful for a wide range of image classification tasks. You can adjust the number of trainable layers according to your dataset size and computational resources.
    
5.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Choices like the number of filters in convolutional layers, the size of the filters, the type of activation function, the dropout rate, and many others are hyperparameters of the model that can affect its performance. Grid search, random search, and more advanced methods like Bayesian optimization can be used to search for the best hyperparameters.
    

Remember that each of these guidelines are heuristic in nature, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. You should be prepared to do a lot of experimentations to fine-tune the model architecture and hyperparameters for your specific task. And always use a separate validation set to evaluate your choices to avoid overfitting to your test set.

### Examples (if any): 

*Ok let's go back to my example of the 100x100 input image. Let's assume that I'm using densely connected layers. What is the math involved with calculating the number of layers needed? How are kernel sizes determined?*


Designing the architecture of a convolutional neural network, including choosing the number of layers and kernel sizes, involves a lot of empirical tuning and is not something that has a clear-cut mathematical formula. However, we can provide a bit of intuition.

1.  **Number of Layers:** There's no formula to calculate the optimal number of layers. It's highly dependent on the complexity of your problem and the amount of data you have. A more complex problem or a larger dataset might benefit from more layers, but more layers can also lead to overfitting and longer training times. Empirical testing is generally the way to go here.
    
2.  **Kernel Size:** The kernel size in CNN is a hyperparameter which refers to the breadth and width of the 2D convolution window. Typical dimensions include 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, and occasionally 7x7.
    
    -   A smaller kernel such as 1x1 or 3x3 will be able to capture finer details in the image.
    -   Larger kernels such as 5x5 or 7x7 will capture more global features. However, larger kernels also increase the computational cost, as they involve more parameters.
    
    A common approach in practice is to use 3x3 kernels, as suggested by VGGNet. This choice leads to fewer parameters and computations than larger kernels while still capturing a decent amount of spatial information.
    

There are some useful heuristics about designing the network's architecture:

-   **Shrinking spatial dimensions, growing depth:** Commonly, the width and height of the feature maps are halved (using pooling or stride > 1 in convolution) while the depth (number of filters) is doubled as we go deeper into the network. This design is common in architectures like VGGNet and ResNet. The idea is to slowly reduce spatial dimensions while increasing the capacity to learn more complex features.
    
-   **Bottleneck layers:** Some architectures use "bottleneck" designs, like in ResNet, where the number of filters is first reduced before being increased in order to save on computational costs.
    

Remember, these are general guidelines and might not work perfectly for every problem. Machine learning involves a lot of empirical testing and iteration to find the best model for your specific problem. Some automated solutions like AutoML and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aim to automate this process, but they also require significant computational resources.

*let's drive this point home with a simple tensorflow example showcasing a CNN and its kernel sizes and number of layers*

Here we will use the Fashion MNIST dataset, which is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories. It's a relatively simple dataset perfect for demonstrating CNN architecture:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models

# Load and preprocess data
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data()

train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28, 28, 1))
test_images = test_images.reshape((10000, 28, 28, 1))

# Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0

# Define a simple CNN architecture
model = models.Sequential()

# Conv layer with 32 filters of size 3x3
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))

# Conv layer with 64 filters of size 3x3
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))

# Conv layer with 64 filters of size 3x3
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))

# Add dense layers on top
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(10))

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))

```
