# Depth-First Search (DFS) Implementation Guide

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm used in graph theory to traverse or search through the nodes of a graph. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This guide will walk you through implementing DFS in Python, utilizing an adjacency list for graph representation.

## Graph Representation

In graph theory, an adjacency list is a common way to represent a graph. It lists each vertex of the graph and its adjacent vertices. In Python, we can use a dictionary to map each vertex to its list of adjacent vertices.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Representing the Graph

First, let's define our graph in Python using an adjacency list.

```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}
```

In this graph, the keys of the dictionary are the nodes of the graph, and the values are lists of nodes that are adjacent to the key node.

### Step 2: DFS Algorithm

The DFS algorithm can be implemented using recursion or a stack. Here, we'll use recursion for its simplicity and readability.

The basic idea of DFS is to start from a selected node (root), mark it as visited, and recursively visit each of its adjacent unvisited nodes.

```python
def dfs(visited, graph, node):  # Function for DFS
    if node not in visited:
        print(node)
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbour in graph[node]:
            dfs(visited, graph, neighbour)

# Set to keep track of visited nodes.
visited = set()
```

### Step 3: Running the DFS Algorithm

Now, let's traverse the graph starting from vertex 'A'.

```python
# Driver Code
dfs(visited, graph, 'A')
```

### Full DFS Implementation

Combining all the steps, here is the full implementation of the DFS algorithm.

```python
def dfs(visited, graph, node):  # Function for DFS
    if node not in visited:
        print(node)
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbour in graph[node]:
            dfs(visited, graph, neighbour)

# The graph represented as an adjacency list
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}

# Set to keep track of visited nodes of the graph.
visited = set()

# Driver Code
dfs(visited, graph, 'A')
```

## Conclusion

You have now implemented the Depth-First Search algorithm using Python and an adjacency list to represent the graph. DFS is a powerful tool for graph traversal, and understanding its implementation is crucial for many computer science and software engineering problems, especially in coding interviews.

Remember, the key to mastering algorithms is practice and understanding the underlying principles. Try modifying the graph or the DFS algorithm to explore different scenarios and deepen your understanding.
