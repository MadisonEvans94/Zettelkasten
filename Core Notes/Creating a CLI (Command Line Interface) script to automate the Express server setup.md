### Subject Title:


Creating a CLI (Command Line Interface) script to automate the Express server setup process requires knowledge of a scripting language like Bash or JavaScript. Here's an example of how you could do it using Node.js and shelljs, a library which allows you to run shell commands in a simple way:

First, you'll need to install shelljs globally:

```bash
npm install -g shelljs
```

Then, you can create a JavaScript file, say `createExpressApp.js`, and put the following code in it:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

const shell = require('shelljs');
const fs = require('fs');

// Check command line arguments
if (process.argv.length !== 3) {
  console.log("Usage: node createExpressApp.js <directory>");
  process.exit(1);
}

const dir = process.argv[2];

// Create the new directory and navigate into it
shell.mkdir('-p', dir);
shell.cd(dir);

// Initialize new npm project and install express
shell.exec('npm init -y');
shell.exec('npm install express');

// Create app.js with basic express code
const appContent = `
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const port = 5001;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log('Server is listening at http://localhost:' + port);
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});
`;

fs.writeFileSync('app.js', appContent);

// Update package.json to make it compatible with ES6
const packageJson = require('./package.json');
packageJson.type = "module";
fs.writeFileSync('package.json', JSON.stringify(packageJson, null, 2));
```

Finally, to make the script executable from anywhere, add it to your PATH. This can be done by moving it to a directory that's already in your PATH (like `/usr/local/bin`), or by adding its current directory to your PATH.

Note that this script will not work on Windows because the Node.js `fs` and `path` modules behave differently on Windows. To make it cross-platform, you would need to add checks for the operating system and adjust the file paths accordingly.

As a final note, while this script will get you up and running quickly, you may find that as your projects become more complex you need more control over your setup process. In this case, you might find a tool like Yeoman useful, which can scaffold out projects based on custom templates.
