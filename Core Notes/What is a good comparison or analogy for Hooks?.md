###### upstream: [[Hooks]]

### Origin of Thought:
- need to strenghten understanding of hooks by relating to other topics 

### Underlying Question: 
What is a good comparison or analogy for Hooks that will help me better understand 


### Solution/Reasoning: 
One way to think about React Hooks is that they are like pluggable pieces of state and lifecycle features that you can "hook" into functional components. They allow you to take these pieces and insert them into your function, hence giving that function additional capabilities.

Imagine your functional component as a bare room in a house, and hooks are pieces of furniture that you add to make the room functional and comfortable. You can pick and choose which pieces of furniture (hooks) you want to add based on what you need the room for (the functionality you want in your component). Just like you would add a bed to a bedroom, you can add a state to a component using the `useState` hook.

Comparing to another coding topic, hooks are somewhat like [[Middleware]] in Express.js or [[decorators]] in python. In an Express app, middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response objects, and the next middleware function. They can execute any code, modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function in the stack. This can be seen as similar to hooks, as they are also functions that provide a way to extend the functionality of another function (the component), by allowing you to add state, side effects, context, and more.

However, it's important to note that these analogies are not perfect and may not cover all aspects of what hooks are and what they can do. Hooks are a powerful feature in React and the best way to understand them is to use them in practice.

### Examples (if any):
