[[RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)]]s are powerful tools for modeling sequential data. One of the fundamental concepts in RNNs is the distinction between the "hidden state" and the "output." Understanding the role and difference between these two components is crucial for building and interpreting RNN-based models.

## 1. Hidden State $( h_t )$

### Definition:
The hidden state is an internal state of the RNN at each time-step $( t )$. It encapsulates the information that the network has seen so far in the sequence up to $( t )$.

### Role:
- **Memory of the Network**: The hidden state serves as the RNN's memory. It carries forward information from previous time-steps to influence the processing of future inputs.
- **Bridge Across Time-steps**: The hidden state from one time-step $( h_{t-1} )$ is used as an input to the RNN cell of the next time-step $( h_t )$, forming a chain of information flow.

### Computation:
In a vanilla RNN, the hidden state $( h_t )$ is computed as:
$[ h_t = \tanh(W_{hh} \cdot h_{t-1} + W_{xh} \cdot x_t + b_h) ]$
where:
- $( W_{hh} )$ and $( W_{xh} )$ are weight matrices.
- $( x_t )$ is the input at time-step $( t )$.
- $( b_h )$ is the bias.

> Essentially we pass $x_t$ through it's own dense layer, $h_{t-1}$ through it's own dense layer, and then pass the sum of these two outputs through $tanh$ function to get the next hidden state $h_t$

## 2. Output $( y_t )$

### Definition:
The output is what the RNN produces as a result at each time-step $( t )$. Depending on the application, it might represent predictions, scores, or any other suitable representation.

### Role:
- **Task-specific Representation**: The output is tailored based on the specific problem you're addressing (e.g., token prediction, sentiment classification).
- **End Result of the Network**: While the hidden state is more of an intermediate representation, the output is what you typically use to compute the loss and back-propagate errors during training.

### Computation:
The output $( y_t )$ in a vanilla RNN is often computed as:
$[ y_t = \text{softmax}(W_{hy} \cdot h_t + b_y) ]$
where:
- $( W_{hy} )$ is the weight matrix connecting the hidden state to the output.
- $( b_y )$ is the bias.

> the difference between hidden state and output is essentially a separate dense layer specifically built for the output, passed through a soft-max

## Key Differences:

1. **Purpose**: Hidden state is an internal representation maintaining sequential memory, while the output is designed for external tasks (e.g., predictions).
2. **Dimensionality**: The dimensionality of the hidden state is often chosen based on the desired memory capacity or model complexity. In contrast, the output dimensionality is usually determined by the specific task (e.g., number of classes in classification).
3. **Flow**: The hidden state flows across time-steps, while the output is typically generated at each time-step based on the current hidden state.

## Conclusion:

While both hidden state and output are integral components of RNNs, they serve different roles. The hidden state acts as the memory of the network, capturing sequential patterns, whereas the output is tailored for specific tasks and represents the final result produced by the network at each time-step.
