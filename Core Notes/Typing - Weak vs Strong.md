### Main Takeaways
- the terms "strongly" and "weakly" typed are kind of subjective
- strongly typed just means that a language strictly enforces its type declarations relative to other languages (c is a good example of a strongly typed language)
- Typescript takes a weakly typed language (JS) and turns it to strongly typed

### Why
- Strongly Typed languages have several benefits 
	- **Compile Time Optimization**
	- **Memory Management**
	- **Error Detection**
	- **Predictability**

### How
- See [[Linters]] for more info
