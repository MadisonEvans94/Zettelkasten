Brain Dump: 

- common names vs systematic name
- IUPAC 
- how to name
	- find the longest carbon chain and give it a root name 
	- identify the highest priority functional group and add its suffix to the root name
	- identify the types of substituents and their positions on the carbon chain, then add a numbered prefix to the root name 
- hydrocarbons 
- functional groups (double bonds and triple bonds) (alkene and alkyne)
- substituents
- di, tri, hetra

Think of naming like a puzzle with rules that we need to learn in order to play
