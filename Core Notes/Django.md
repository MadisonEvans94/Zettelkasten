## Important Modules 

Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, which is a variation of the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Let's break down the main modules you'll need to familiarize yourself with:

1. **Models**: This layer interacts with your database. It defines your data structure, essentially your database schema, and includes the business logic around the data. Understanding models is crucial for handling the backend of your application.

2. **Views**: Views act as the business logic layer where you define the logic that runs when a specific URL is hit. They request information from the models, and pass it to templates. Grasping views is vital for the workflow of your application.

3. **Templates**: Templates are the presentation layer in Django. They control how the user interface is displayed. They are often HTML files with Django Template Language (DTL) elements, allowing dynamic data rendering.

4. **URL Dispatcher**: A URL dispatcher is your URL-to-view mapping. It’s a pattern-matching system that matches URL patterns (defined as strings) to Python callback functions (views).

5. **Admin Interface**: One of Django's most powerful components, the admin interface, provides a ready-to-use interface for managing your app's data. It's a great tool for quick CRUD operations on your models.

6. **Forms**: Django's forms handle the nitty-gritty of form creation and processing. It's a powerful feature for validating and cleaning user input and is essential for user interaction.

7. **Settings**: The settings module includes configurations for your Django project, like database configuration, installed apps, middleware setup, templates settings, etc.

8. **Middleware**: Middleware in Django is a framework of hooks and a global mechanism for altering the input or output of Django’s views.

9. **Authentication and Authorization**: This module handles user authentication and permission setting, an essential part of most web applications.

10. **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**: Although technically part of models, Django’s ORM deserves a special mention. It allows you to interact with your database using Python code instead of SQL.

11. **Testing**: Django has a built-in testing framework which is a powerful tool to test your applications.

Each of these modules plays a crucial role in a Django application, and gaining proficiency in them will make you proficient in Django as a whole. As you learn, remember to balance theory with practice by building small projects or features, which is an effective way to consolidate your understanding and skills. Happy coding!

## Workflow 

Building a Django application involves several stages from setting up the environment to deploying the application. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you through this process:

### 1. Setting Up A Python Virtual Environment
> see [[Setting Up A Python Virtual Environment]]

### 2. Installing Django

```zsh
pip install django
```
### 3. Creating a New Django Project
```
django-admin startproject myproject
```

The Django project structure can be a bit counterintuitive at first. When you run `django-admin startproject <project_name> .`, the dot at the end of the command is crucial because it tells Django to create the project files and directories in the current directory, rather than creating a new directory beneath it. Here's what happens:

- `manage.py`: This script is placed in the current directory.
- `headspace_project/`: This directory is created to hold your project's package. It contains settings, URLs, WSGI and ASGI configurations for your project.

When you then run `python manage.py startapp myapp`, Django creates a new directory for the app at the same level as the project directory. This is by design. The `startapp` command doesn't know about your project structure; it just creates a new app directory in your current directory. Here’s how the structure looks after running these commands:

```
current_directory/
|-- your_project/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- settings.py
|   |-- urls.py
|   |-- asgi.py
|   |-- wsgi.py
|-- myapp/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- admin.py
|   |-- apps.py
|   |-- migrations/
|   |   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- models.py
|   |-- tests.py
|   |-- views.py
|-- manage.py
```

The reason apps are created alongside the project directory, rather than inside it, is that Django apps are meant to be pluggable. This means that an app should be able to work in any project, not just the one it was created in. By not nesting apps within a specific project directory, Django reinforces the concept that apps are independent components.

If you prefer to have apps inside your project directory, you can simply move the app directory into the project directory after creation or specify a path when creating the app:

```bash
python manage.py startapp myapp headspace_project/myapp
```

This will create the app inside your project directory like so:

```
current_directory/
|-- headspace_project/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- settings.py
|   |-- urls.py
|   |-- asgi.py
|   |-- wsgi.py
|   |-- myapp/
|       |-- __init__.py
|       |-- admin.py
|       |-- apps.py
|       |-- migrations/
|       |   |-- __init__.py
|       |-- models.py
|       |-- tests.py
|       |-- views.py
|-- manage.py
```

However, the flat structure is the default Django way, and it's usually better to stick with the conventions of the framework unless you have a specific reason to deviate. It keeps the top-level directory clean and makes it easier to identify which directories are Django apps.

### 4. Setting Up the Database

Configure your database in `settings.py`. Django defaults to SQLite. If you want to use another database like PostgreSQL, you will need to install the appropriate database bindings and configure it in the `DATABASES` setting.

> Jump to `settings.py` for more 
### 5. Create Django Apps

```zsh
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

Yes, after creating your `users` app, the next step is to add it to the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in your `settings.py` file. This tells Django to include the app in various management and operational tasks, like running migrations, testing, and rendering models in the Django admin interface.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the `settings.py` file in your Django project. This file is located in the project directory (the one that contains `wsgi.py` and `asgi.py`).

2. Locate the `INSTALLED_APPS` list. It's a Python list containing strings that represent Django applications that are active for your project.

3. Add a string with the name of your app to this list. Since your app is named `users`, you would add `'users'` to the list. Be sure to include the app name as a string and follow Python's list syntax, including commas after each item.

   It should look something like this:

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # Default Django apps...
       'django.contrib.admin',
       'django.contrib.auth',
       'django.contrib.contenttypes',
       'django.contrib.sessions',
       'django.contrib.messages',
       'django.contrib.staticfiles',

       # Your custom app
       'users',  # Add your app name here
   ]
   ```

4. Save the changes to `settings.py`.

5. Run migrations to apply any changes to the database:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

   This is especially important if your `users` app contains any models, as Django needs to create the necessary database tables for them.

6. Optionally, if you want to include the app in the Django admin interface, you should register its models in the `admin.py` file within the `users` app directory.

Adding your app to `INSTALLED_APPS` is a crucial step in integrating it with the Django project. It allows your app to be recognized and properly integrated into the overall project infrastructure.

### 6. Defining Models

In your app directory, define models in `models.py`. These classes represent tables in your database.

> jump to `models.py` for more
### 7. Database Migrations

Once you define your models, you'll need to create migrations and apply them to your database:

```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 8. Creating an Admin User

```shell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 9. Running the Development Server

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```
### 10. Implementing Views and Templates

Views handle the logic of your application, and templates define the HTML of your pages. You'll create these in the `views.py` and templates directory, respectively.

> see `views.py` for more

### 11. Configuring URLs
Configure your URL patterns in `urls.py` to connect views to their corresponding URLs

> see `urls.py` for more
### 12. Static and Media Files
Set up handling for static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) and media files uploaded by users in `settings.py`
### 13. User Authentication
Implement user registration, login, and logout functionalities if your app requires user authentication.

> See [[Django User Authentication]] for more
### 14. Forms
Create forms to handle user input, either using Django forms or model forms.

> See [[Handling Forms In Django]] for more
### 15. Testing

Write tests for your views, models, and forms in the `tests.py` file of your apps.

> See [[Testing In Django]] for more 

### 16. Deployment Preparation

Prepare your app for deployment by setting `DEBUG` to `False`, configuring a production database, and collecting static files.

### 17. Deployment

Choose a hosting service and deploy your app. This might involve transferring files, configuring a web server, and setting up a production database.

### 18. Monitoring and Maintenance

After deployment, monitor your app for errors and performance issues. Regularly update the app and its dependencies for security and performance improvements.
### Additional Steps

- **Security Settings**: Review the security settings provided by Django, including middleware settings and user-uploaded content handling.
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize query performance and consider caching for high-traffic sites.
- **Task Queues**: If your app includes long-running processes, set up a task queue with Celery.
- **APIs**: For applications needing an API, use Django REST framework to build it.

Throughout these stages, you'll be writing and updating your `settings.py` file to tailor your app's configuration. Remember to use the Django documentation as it is comprehensive and provides a good guide for best practices.
