Creating a GraphQL API involves several steps: defining a schema, writing resolvers, and setting up a server. I'll give you a simple example using JavaScript and the `express-graphql` library.

First, install the necessary libraries using npm (Node.js package manager):
```bash
npm install express express-graphql graphql
```

Then, you can create an `index.js` file for your server:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');
const { buildSchema } = require('graphql');

// Define your schema
const schema = buildSchema(`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`);

// Define your resolvers
const root = {
  hello: () => {
    return 'Hello, world!';
  },
};

// Set up your server
const app = express();
app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema: schema,
  rootValue: root,
  graphiql: true,
}));

app.listen(4000, () => console.log('Running a GraphQL API server at localhost:4000/graphql'));
```

This creates a simple GraphQL server that responds to the `hello` query with the string `'Hello, world!'`. You can test it by starting your server with `node index.js` and then navigating to `http://localhost:4000/graphql` in your web browser. In the GraphiQL interface, try running the query `{ hello }`.

In a real-world application, your schema would define many more types representing your data, and your resolvers would fetch data from a database or other data sources based on the incoming queries.

It's important to note that there are also many tools and libraries available to help with more complex GraphQL servers, like [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) for JavaScript, [Graphene](https://graphene-python.org/) for Python, and [graphql-ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org/) for Ruby. These provide features like type safety, advanced error handling, automatic generation of resolvers from your database schema, and more.
