# Family Tree Application Overview

## Introduction
The Family Tree application is an interactive tool that visualizes family relationships. It allows users to view a graphical representation of family members and their connections. The application uses React and GraphQL to manage data flow and UI rendering.

---
## Components

### `FamilyTreePage`
The entry point of the family tree feature. It fetches family member data via GraphQL and displays the family tree.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Fetch all family members using the `GET_FAMILY_MEMBERS` GraphQL query.
  - Display the family tree interface or loading/error messages.

### `FamilyTreeUI`
A container component that encapsulates the family tree UI, including the search bar and the tree visualization.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Toggle visibility of the form to create new family members.
  - Render the `TreeComponent` with the family members data.

### `TreeComponent`
Responsible for rendering the family tree using `ReactFlow`. It lays out the family tree nodes and edges.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handle node click events to fetch detailed data for a specific family member.
  - Use `generateTreeLayout` to create the visual layout of the family tree.

### `FamilyMemberNode`
Defines the appearance and behavior of each node in the family tree, representing individual family members.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Render the visual representation of a family member.
  - Include handles for incoming and outgoing edges.

### `SearchBarContainer`
Presents a UI for users to search through the family tree.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Allow users to input search queries.
  - Potentially filter the family tree based on search criteria.

---
## Helper Functions

### `generateTreeLayout`
Generates the layout for the family tree nodes and edges.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Calculate positions for each node (family member) based on their relationships.
  - Create edges to represent the connections between family members.

---

## Pages

### `FamilyTreePage`
The main page component that hosts the family tree.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Renders the `FamilyTreeUI` component.
  - Acts as a bridge between the GraphQL data layer and the family tree visualization.

---

## Types

### `FamilyMember`
```ts
export interface FamilyMember {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	DOB: string;
	children: { id: string }[];
	father: { id: string };
	mother: { id: string };
}
```

### `treeGraphElements`
Defines the props for the `TreeComponent`, which includes the data array of family members to be visualized.

```ts
export interface TreeComponentProps {
	data: FamilyMember[];
}
```
### `FamilyMemberNodeProps`
Extends from `NodeProps` from React Flow Renderer and includes additional data specific to the family tree, such as the family member's label and id.
```ts
export interface FamilyMemberNodeProps extends NodeProps {
	data: {
		label: string;
		id: string;
	};
}
```
### `LayoutedElements`
Holds the structured data for nodes and edges after the layout has been generated.
```ts

```

### `FamilyTreeNode` and `FamilyTreeEdge`
Interfaces representing the nodes and edges within the family tree.

### `FamilyMembersData` and `FamilyMember`
Interfaces for the data structure of family members as fetched from GraphQL.

### `FamilyTreeUIProps`
Defines the props for the `FamilyTreeUI`, which includes the structured data for all family members.

---
## Data Flow

1. **Data Fetching**: Upon loading the `FamilyTreePage`, a GraphQL query `GET_FAMILY_MEMBERS` is made to fetch all family members.
   
2. **Data Visualization**: The fetched data is passed to `FamilyTreeUI`, which renders `TreeComponent`. `TreeComponent` calls `generateTreeLayout` to calculate the layout for nodes and edges based on the fetched family members.

3. **User Interaction**: When a node in `TreeComponent` is clicked, it triggers a GraphQL query `GET_FAMILY_MEMBER_BY_ID` to fetch and display more detailed information about that family member.

4. **UI Update**: The `FamilyTreeUI` may display additional UI elements such as a form for adding new family members, which can be shown or hidden based on user interaction.

## Role of `dagre`: 

In the `TreeComponent`, dagre is used to automatically lay out the nodes and edges of a graph (in this case, a family tree). Overall, dagre is providing an automatic way to calculate the positions of nodes in a grap

1. **Creating a new directed graph**: `new dagre.graphlib.Graph()` creates a new graph that dagre will work with. A graph in this context is a set of nodes (individuals in the family tree) connected by edges (relationships between them). The directed graph will have edges with a direction, meaning they go from a parent to a child, indicating the flow of the relationship.

2. **Setting default edge labels**: `dagreGraph.setDefaultEdgeLabel(() => ({}))` sets a default label object for new edges. In dagre, edges can have labels, which might contain metadata about the relationship. Here it's just an empty object since no specific labels are needed.

3. **Setting graph parameters**: `dagreGraph.setGraph(TREE_PARAMS)` sets the layout parameters for the graph. `TREE_PARAMS` likely includes settings like the direction to layout the graph (`TB` for top to bottom, `LR` for left to right, etc.), distances between nodes, and other configuration options that affect how the graph is drawn.

4. **Adding nodes and edges to the graph**: The `nodes.forEach` and `edges.forEach` loops add nodes and edges to the dagre graph. Each node and edge from the family data is added to the dagre graph, with nodes being assigned a size (width and height).

5. **Running the layout algorithm**: `dagre.layout(dagreGraph)` takes the graph that has been set up and applies a layout algorithm to determine the `x` and `y` positions of each node so that they are placed in a way that visually makes sense (parents above children, minimizing crossing edges, etc.).

6. **Mapping nodes to their new positions**: The `mappedNodes` array is created by mapping over the `nodes` array. Each node's position is fetched from the dagre graph after the layout algorithm has been run, which gives the calculated position for that node. An additional small random value is added to the `x` position to prevent rendering issues that can occur when nodes overlap exactly.

Overall, dagre is providing an automatic way to calculate the positions of nodes in a graph, which is especially helpful when the graph could be large or complex, as family trees often are. It abstracts away the complex math and algorithms needed to make a graph look good and be understandable at a glance.
