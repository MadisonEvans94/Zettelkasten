[[Matching Data types With Corresponding Visualizations]]

[[Design Principles]]: This includes understanding concepts like color theory, hierarchy, balance, contrast, and consistency. A good visualization is not just informative but also aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand at a glance.

[[Data Preparation and Data Cleaning]]: Before visualizing data, you'll often need to prepare and clean it. This might involve handling missing values, outliers, or errors, normalizing or standardizing data, or transforming it in various ways. Knowledge of libraries for data manipulation, such as Lodash in JavaScript, can be useful here.

[[Interaction Design]]: Dashboards aren't just static displays of information; they're often interactive, allowing users to filter data, zoom into specific time periods, drill down into detailed views, etc. Understanding how to design these interactions in a user-friendly way is a valuable skill.
