###### upstream: [[Containers]]

### Origin of Thought:
- Both decouple and encapsulate data

### Underlying Question: 
Is there a similarity in the function of generics and containers, despite them both being drastically different things ?

### Solution/Reasoning: 
-   **Containers (like Docker)**: A container is like a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. It provides a consistent and reproducible environment, no matter where it's run.
    
-   **Generics**: In the context of programming languages, a generic is like a template that can operate over a variety of types. The actual type that the generic operates on is specified later, when the generic is used. This makes the code more reusable and type-safe.
    

The analogy comes into play when you think about the way both containers and generics provide a consistent, reusable framework that can be filled with different contents:

-   A Docker container provides a consistent environment that can be filled with different software. No matter what software you put inside the container, it will always run the same way, because the container provides a consistent, reproducible environment.
    
-   Similarly, a generic provides a consistent, reusable code structure that can be filled with different types. No matter what type you use with the generic, it will always behave the same way, because the generic provides a consistent, type-safe code structure.
    

In both cases, the container or generic doesn't know or care about the specifics of what's inside it (whether that's a specific type for the generic, or a specific piece of software for the Docker container). It just provides a consistent, reusable framework that ensures everything works correctly, no matter what specific contents you're working with. Kinda like [[Encapsulation]]
