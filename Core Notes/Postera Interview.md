Designing a molecular similarity search service capable of handling billions of molecules requires several key architectural and technological decisions. I have outlined a few potential strategies below:

### NoSQL Databases for Molecular Data Storage

I would consider utilizing a NoSQL database, such as MongoDB or DynamoDB, for storing molecular data. These databases excel at handling unstructured or semi-structured data, which is common in molecular datasets.

**Reasons for this approach:**
- NoSQL databases scale horizontally
- They can handle increased loads by distributing data across multiple nodes
- They maintain high performance even as the dataset grows (especially for this task which is a read heavy operation)
- They are adept at handling queries across large volumes of data where entity relationships are not overly complex



### Parallel Computing for Similarity Calculations

The similarity score calculation between a query molecule and known molecules will be parallelized to improve computational efficiency. Frameworks such as Apache Spark could be utilized for a distributed computing approach 


**Reasons for this approach**:
  - Frameworks such as Apaches spark utilize MapReduce to distribute the calculation workload across multiple nodes. When dealing with potentially millions of comparisons per query molecule, this could present noticeable performance gains
