### Details:

In `Express.js`, `req.params` is an object that contains properties mapped to the named route "parameters". 

For instance, if you have a route definition like `/posts/:id`, then whatever value is passed in the place of `:id` in the actual URL will be accessible as `req.params.id`.

In another example, `app.get('/posts/:id', ...)`, **`:id`** is a route parameter. If you were to navigate to `/posts/5` in your web browser, inside your route handler `req.params.id` would equal `"5"`. 

### Why us it? 

This mechanism is very useful for creating **dynamic routes**. For example, if you're creating a blog system, you can use the same route handler to display each individual post by replacing `:id` with the post's ID.

*It's important to note* that `req.params` always contains strings because it comes from the URL. Even though they might look like numbers, you should remember to convert them using `Number()`, `parseInt()`, or similar methods if you need to do numeric operations with them, as demonstrated in your example.

### so if I looked at `req.params` instead of r`eq.params.id`, what would I expect to find?

If you look at `req.params` instead of `req.params.id`, you would find an object that includes all route parameters as **key-value** pairs.

*For example*, if a request was made to `/posts/123`, `req.params` would be:

```javascript
{
  id: '123'
}
```

If you had more parameters in your route, you would see them as well. 

*For example,* if you had a route like `/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId` and a request was made to `/posts/123/comments/456`, `req.params` would be:

```javascript
{
  postId: '123',
  commentId: '456'
}
```

Again, remember that the values in `req.params` are always strings, so you may need to convert them if you need to use them as numbers.
