## Stacked RNN

A Stacked RNN, also known as a Deep RNN, refers to an RNN where multiple layers of recurrent cells are stacked on top of each other. This is analogous to having multiple layers in deep feedforward neural networks or convolutional neural networks.

### Key Characteristics:

1. **Multiple Recurrent Layers**: In a stacked RNN, there are multiple layers of RNN cells. The hidden state from one layer is used as input to the next layer.

2. **Increased Model Capacity**: With more layers, the model has increased capacity, which may help in capturing complex patterns in the data.

3. **Risk of Overfitting**: However, as with all deep architectures, deeper networks have more parameters and can be prone to overfitting, especially with small datasets.

4. **Higher Computational Load**: Due to the increased number of parameters and computations between layers, stacked RNNs typically require more computational resources and time to train.

### Differences from a Simple RNN:

1. **Depth**: A simple RNN usually consists of just one recurrent layer, while a stacked RNN has multiple.

2. **Complexity**: Stacked RNNs can model more complex relationships due to their added depth, but this comes with the costs of increased computation and potential overfitting.

3. **Training Considerations**: Deeper networks may require careful initialization, regularization techniques like dropout, and sometimes different optimization strategies to train effectively.

### Visualization:

If we were to visualize it:

```
Input
  |
RNN Layer 1
  |
RNN Layer 2
  |
 ...
  |
RNN Layer N
  |
Output
```

### Practical Usage:

In practice, stacking RNN layers can be easily achieved in deep learning libraries. For instance, in PyTorch's `nn.RNN` module, the `num_layers` parameter controls the number of stacked layers.

Note: While stacking RNN layers can increase the capacity of a model, it's crucial to monitor overfitting. Techniques like [[Dropout]] are commonly used between RNN layers to help mitigate this issue.
