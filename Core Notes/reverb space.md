Certainly! Since you want to expand the focus of your blog post to explore various techniques for creating space and simulating 3D audio, you can restructure the outline to include sections dedicated to each method. Here's a revised outline that encompasses the broader scope:

## Intro
- Introduction to Spatial Audio and 3D Sound
- Importance of Immersive Audio in Modern Media

## What is Space?
### What is Space in a Visual Context?
- Space in visual art refers to the area within, around, above, or below objects and shapes in art. 
- Creates depth by converging parallel lines.
- light bounces to create context like shadows, blur, and color variation 

### What is Space in an Audio Context?
- Audio space refers to the perceived location and dimension of sound within a sound field.
- **Reverberation**:
  - Reflection, absorption, and diffusion of sound in an environment.
- Panning and binaural characteristics of perceiving sound with two ears

### What Artistic Value Does Space and Depth Bring?
- **Emotional Impact**:
  - Space and depth can evoke feelings of intimacy, grandeur, isolation, etc.
- **Storytelling**:
  - Spatial cues help in narrating a story or guiding the listener's attention.
- **Immersion and Engagement**:
  - Creating a believable space engages the audience more deeply.
- **Aesthetic Choices**:
  - Artists use spatial characteristics to shape the aesthetic and style of the work.
- **Musical Expression**:
  - In music, space affects the timbre, rhythm, and harmony, allowing for expressive variations.

## Methods for Simulating Depth
### Gaussian Blur and What the Equivalent is in an Audio Context
- going back to the similarities that audio and visual share, gaussian blur is a quality that we observe when objects are distant. Why is that? and what would be the equivalent for audio? 
- Similarly, we can perceive depth when our brains notice a difference in what our left eye picks up vs what our right eye picks up. What is the equivalent in audio? 
- What are some terms that we can refer to throughout this paper when talking about these audio characteristics that pertain to depth and localization 
### Psychoacoustic Principles of Depth Perception


## Techniques for Creating Space and 3D Audio
### Convolution Reverb
   - What is Convolution?
	   - mathematical explanation explaining how it's a combination of 2 functions 
	   - How it's different than just adding or multiplying two functions 
	   - An explanation a 12 year old could understand 
   - How Can We Use Convolution to Simulate Certain Recording Environments?
   - How Does Convolution Compare to Classic Reverb Approaches, Both Analog and Digital?

## Conclusion
- Summary of Key Techniques and Their Applications
- Encouragement to Experiment and Innovate

By restructuring the outline in this way, you provide a comprehensive overview of the various techniques for creating space and simulating 3D audio, not just focusing on convolution reverb. This approach will offer readers a broader understanding of the subject and encourage them to explore and experiment with different methods to achieve their desired spatial audio effects.
