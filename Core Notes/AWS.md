### Introduction 

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** provides a broad set of products and services you can use as building blocks to run sophisticated and scalable applications. Running your applications in the AWS Cloud can help you move faster, operate more securely, and save substantial costs; all while benefiting from the scale and performance of the cloud.

### Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Before you start, it's necessary to create an **AWS account**. You can create one by going to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)

### Key AWS Services <a name="key-aws-services"></a>

#### EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
Amazon [[EC2]] provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.

#### S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Amazon [[S3]] is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It's designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability, and stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world.

#### Lambda
[[AWS Lambda]] lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.

#### RDS (Relational Database Service)
[[RDS]] makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups.

#### DynamoDB
[[DynamoDB]] is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.

There are many more services such as VPC, CloudFront, IAM etc. Understanding each service's purpose and capabilities is crucial for every AWS developer.

### Security in AWS <a name="security-in-aws"></a>

AWS provides several security capabilities and services to increase privacy and control network access. These include:

#### **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**:
[[IAM]] Allows management access to AWS services and resources securely. 

#### **Amazon Macie**:
[[Macie]] is a fully managed data privacy and security service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS.

#### **AWS Shield**: 
[[AWS Shield]] is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS.

### Developing on AWS <a name="developing-on-aws"></a>

AWS provides several tools for developers such as **AWS CodeStar**, **AWS CodeCommit**, **AWS CodeBuild**, **AWS CodeDeploy**, and **AWS CodePipeline**. AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.

### Deployment and Management <a name="deployment-and-management"></a>

AWS provides services that help you deploy, monitor, and scale your applications. These include [[AWS Elastic Beanstalk]], [[AWS Cloudformation]], [[Amazon CloudWatch]], and [[AWS Auto Scaling]].

### AWS CLI & SDKs <a name="aws-cli-sdks"></a>


#### **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)**: 
A unified tool to manage your AWS services. It provides direct access to AWS services from a terminal session, making it a useful tool for developers.

#### **SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: 
AWS provides SDKs for a wide range of programming languages, including **Java**, **Python**, **Ruby**, **Node.js**, **.NET**, and more. These SDKs provide convenience methods and abstractions for interacting with AWS services.

### Billing and Pricing <a name="billing-and-pricing"></a>

AWS follows a pay-as-you-go approach to pricing for over *160* cloud services. You pay only for the individual services you need, for as long as you use them, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing.
