## Introduction
**The Domain Name System (DNS)** plays a critical role in helping users reach their desired websites. It's a distributed, hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. This document provides an in-depth overview of the DNS resolution lifecycle.

## DNS Lifecycle

### 1. User Request
When a user types a domain name (like "palettepalapp.com") into a web browser, the browser first needs to find the corresponding IP address. This process starts with a request to the **Internet Service Provider's (ISP's)** DNS resolver.

### 2. DNS Resolver and Cache
The DNS resolver checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP address for "palettepalapp.com". If not, it initiates the DNS lookup process.

### 3. Root and TLD Servers
The DNS resolver queries a root DNS server for the **Top Level Domain (TLD)** server (the '.com' server in this case) that holds information about "palettepalapp.com". The root server responds with the address of the TLD server. The resolver then asks the TLD server for the authoritative DNS server for "palettepalapp.com".

### 4. Domain Registrar and Route 53
The domain registrar (Google Domains in this case) doesn't actually handle the DNS query, but it plays a key role. When you registered "palettepalapp.com" and set up your DNS with AWS Route 53, Google Domains was instructed to point all DNS queries for "palettepalapp.com" to Route 53's DNS servers.

### 5. Route 53 and DNS Records
Next, the DNS resolver queries the Route 53 DNS server for the DNS records of "palettepalapp.com". Route 53 checks its records and returns the appropriate response - a CNAME record in this case, mapping "palettepalapp.com" to a domain like "xyz.cloudfront.net".

### 6. CNAME Resolution
A new DNS query is then made, this time for the CNAME "xyz.cloudfront.net". This request is resolved to the public IP address(es) associated with the AWS CloudFront distribution.

### 7. Content Delivery via CloudFront
With the IP address obtained, the browser sends a request to this address, reaching your CloudFront distribution. CloudFront retrieves the requested content from the nearest edge location. If it's not already cached there, CloudFront fetches it from your Amazon S3 bucket and then caches it at the edge location for future requests.

### 8. Caching and Future Requests
Subsequent requests may skip several of these steps if the DNS information and/or the site content are cached. This greatly reduces the response time.

## Conclusion
Understanding the DNS lifecycle is vital for effectively managing and troubleshooting web services. This document provides a high-level overview of this complex process, showing how a user's browser interacts with multiple servers across the internet to access a website. The key takeaway is that DNS and content delivery services, such as AWS Route 53 and CloudFront, work together seamlessly to provide a smooth user experience.
