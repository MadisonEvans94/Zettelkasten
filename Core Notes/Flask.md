## Installations & Dependencies

First, ensure you are in a new project directory. It's recommended to set up a virtual environment for isolation:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

>On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

>On Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Once your virtual environment is activated, install Flask:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

This will install Flask and its dependencies.

---
## Basic Template 

### 1. Create an `app.py` file with the following code:

```python
# Imports
from flask import Flask

# Create the Flask app object
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a route for the root URL
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello, World!'

# Run the app when the script is executed
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5001)
```

>See [[Attributes and Methods of the Flask App Object]] for more...

### 2. To run the server, execute the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

When the server is running, you should see a message indicating that the server is running on `http://localhost:5001/`.

>Remember, Flask runs in debug mode by default in a development environment, which means that changes in code will auto-reload the server. However, this is not safe for production. When deploying, ensure `debug` is set to `False` or is not set at all.

## Middleware and Hooks

middleware and hooks allow developers to execute functions at various points during the request/response cycle. They are essential for tasks like pre-processing requests, managing sessions, logging, and post-processing responses. 
### Hooks

functions that get executed before or after certain phases of the request/response lifecycle. They are most commonly used for setting up or tearing down database connections, logging, and modifying request or response objects.

1. **`before_request`**:
   - Triggered before a request is dispatched to a view function.
   - Does not take any parameters.
   - Example:
     ```python
     @app.before_request
     def log_request_info():
         app.logger.info("Headers: %s", request.headers)
     ```

2. **`before_first_request`**:
   - Runs once before the first request to this instance of the application.
   - Example:
     ```python
     @app.before_first_request
     def initialize_database():
         app.logger.info("Setting up the database...")
     ```

3. **`after_request`**:
   - Triggered after a view function finishes processing but before the response is sent back to the client.
   - Must take one parameter: the response that will be sent to the client.
   - Example:
     ```python
     @app.after_request
     def add_security_headers(response):
         response.headers["X-Frame-Options"] = "DENY"
         return response
     ```

4. **`teardown_request`**:
   - Triggered after the response is sent to the client, even if an exception occurred during processing.
   - It is passed an error object if an exception occurred.
   - Commonly used for database cleanup.
   - Example:
     ```python
     @app.teardown_request
     def close_database_connection(error):
         app.logger.info("Closing database connection...")
     ```

### Middleware

Middleware in Flask is generally used to "wrap" the application in one or more layers to process requests or responses. It can be useful for tasks like logging, error handling, and other pre- or post-processing tasks.

1. **Using a WSGI Middleware**:
   Flask applications can be wrapped with standard WSGI middleware. Here's an example that uses the Werkzeug's `ProxyFix` middleware to correct the environment when running behind a reverse proxy:

   ```python
   from werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix import ProxyFix
   
   app = Flask(__name__)
   app.wsgi_app = ProxyFix(app.wsgi_app)
   ```

2. **Custom Middleware**:
   Create a custom middleware by defining a class or function that wraps around the app's `wsgi_app`:

   ```python
   class SimpleMiddleware(object):
       def __init__(self, app):
           self.app = app

       def __call__(self, environ, start_response):
           app.logger.info('Doing some pre-processing...')
           return self.app(environ, start_response)
   
   app.wsgi_app = SimpleMiddleware(app.wsgi_app)
   ```

These are just foundational concepts related to middleware and hooks in Flask. To dive deeper, consider exploring Flask's documentation and other online resources.

#### Popular Middleware 

1. **Werkzeug's `ProxyFix`**:
   - Adjusts the app's environment when it's behind a reverse proxy. This is especially useful when dealing with headers like `X-Forwarded-For`.

2. **Flask-CORS**:
   - Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making cross-origin AJAX possible.

3. **Flask-Session**:
   - Enhances session handling, allowing you to specify different kinds of session interfaces, including Redis, Memcached, and filesystem.

4. **Flask-Limiter**:
   - Provides rate limiting features to control how fast clients can hit your app.

5. **Flask-SSLify**:
   - Redirects incoming requests to HTTPS.

6. **Flask-Talisman**:
   - Enforces HTTPS and provides other security headers for increased web app security.

7. **Flask-Login**:
   - Provides session management and user authentication, making it easier to manage user sessions.

8. **Flask-WTF**:
   - Integrates Flask with WTForms, simplifying form handling, including validation and rendering.

9. **Flask-Compress**:
   - Compresses responses with Gzip to reduce bandwidth.

10. **Flask-Caching**:
    - Adds caching support, which can significantly improve app performance by storing the results of expensive or frequent operations.

11. **Flask-OAuthlib**:
    - Adds OAuth provider and consumer support, facilitating integration with OAuth services like Twitter, GitHub, and more.

12. **Flask-RESTful**:
    - Aids in the quick building of REST APIs.

13. **Flask-DebugToolbar**:
    - Adds an on-page debugger during development, providing insights into performance and application behavior.

> Remember, middleware and extensions sometimes overlap in functionality. When integrating middleware into your Flask application, always consult the official documentation or repository of the middleware to ensure proper usage and understand any nuances or specific configurations.

## Database Interaction

Interacting with databases is a core part of many web applications. Flask, while being a micro-framework, doesnâ€™t dictate a specific ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). However, Flask-SQLAlchemy is a popular choice that provides flexible and easy integration with a variety of databases.

### Flask-SQLAlchemy

Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension that provides SQLAlchemy support to Flask applications. It simplifies database operations and helps manage connections.

#### Installation:

```bash
pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
```

#### Basic Configuration:

1. **SQLite**:

   SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database. It's excellent for development or applications that don't require high concurrency.

   ```python
   from flask import Flask
   from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

   app = Flask(__name__)
   app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///your_database_file.db'
   db = SQLAlchemy(app)
   ```

2. **MySQL**:

   MySQL is a widely-used, open-source relational database management system.

   First, you need to install the required package:

   ```bash
   pip install pymysql
   ```

   Then, set up your Flask app:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask
   from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

   app = Flask(__name__)
   app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql+pymysql://username:password@localhost/dbname'
   db = SQLAlchemy(app)
   ```

#### Defining Models:

Models in Flask-SQLAlchemy represent tables in the database. Here's a basic example of defining a User model:

```python
class User(db.Model):
   id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
   username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
   email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

   def __repr__(self):
       return f'<User {self.username}>'
```

#### Creating and Querying Data:

After defining models, you can perform various operations like creating, querying, updating, and deleting data.

1. **Creating Tables**:

   ```python
   db.create_all()
   ```

2. **Inserting Data**:

   ```python
   new_user = User(username="john_doe", email="john@example.com")
   db.session.add(new_user)
   db.session.commit()
   ```

3. **Querying Data**:

   ```python
   users = User.query.all()  # Get all users
   user = User.query.filter_by(username="john_doe").first()  # Get a specific user
   ```

#### Handling Migrations:

For evolving your database schema over time without losing data, you can use Flask-Migrate, an extension that handles SQLAlchemy database migrations:

```bash
pip install Flask-Migrate
```

After installing, integrate it into your Flask app and use commands to initialize migrations, migrate, and upgrade.
