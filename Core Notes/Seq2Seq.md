**Seq2Seq**, short for "*sequence-to-sequence*," is a type of machine learning model that converts one sequence into another sequence. It's like a translator: it takes in a sentence (sequence of words) in one language, understands what it means, and then produces a corresponding sentence (another sequence of words) in a different language. But instead of just working with languages, it can work with any kind of sequence data - such as time series data, music notes, and more.

At its core, a Seq2Seq model consists of two main parts:

1.  **Encoder**: This is the part that reads and understands the input sequence. Imagine it like someone who listens and understands a sentence in a foreign language.
    
2.  **Decoder**: This part generates the output sequence based on what the encoder has understood. It's like the person who then translates the understood sentence into a different language.
    

So, a Seq2Seq model is just a system that learns to map sequences to sequences, making it great for tasks like translation, speech recognition, and even image captioning!
