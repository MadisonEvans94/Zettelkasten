## Overview
The `useContext` hook in React allows you to read and subscribe to context within your component. It's a mechanism to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

### Basic Usage
```javascript
import { useContext } from 'react';
const value = useContext(SomeContext);
```
- **Parameters**: `SomeContext` is the context you've created with `createContext`.
- **Returns**: The context value for the calling component, determined by the closest `SomeContext.Provider` above it in the component tree.

### Key Points
1. **Passing Data Deeply**: `useContext` allows data to be passed deep into the component tree without manually threading it through every component【7†source】.
2. **Updating Data**: Combine context with state to update context values. Changing the state updates the context for all components that consume it【8†source】.
3. **Fallback Default Value**: If no provider is found, `useContext` returns a default value defined at context creation【9†source】.
4. **Overriding Context**: Context can be overridden for a part of the component tree by wrapping that part in a provider with a different value【10†source】.
5. **Optimizing Re-renders**: Avoid unnecessary re-renders when passing objects and functions by using `useCallback` and `useMemo`【11†source】.
6. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues include incorrect provider placement and build system issues causing different instances of the same context【12†source】.

### Caveats
- The `useContext()` call is not influenced by providers returned from the same component. It always looks for the closest provider above the component that calls it【6†source】.

## Conclusion
`useContext` is a powerful hook in React for managing context and passing data efficiently through the component tree. Understanding its usage and caveats is crucial for building scalable and maintainable React applications.
