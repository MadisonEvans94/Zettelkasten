### First, what is dotenv actually doing?

When you use `dotenv` in your Node.js application, what you're essentially doing is setting environment variables locally for your application's process. These variables are available to your application through the global `process.env` object in Node.js.

`dotenv` reads a `.env` file in your project directory and injects the key-value pairs as environment variables at runtime. This happens in your local development machine's memory and only for the current process where your Node.js application is running. 

This means that if you start your application with `node app.js`, all the environment variables from the `.env` file are only available to the `app.js` process and any child processes it spawns. Other applications or processes running on your system don't have access to these variables.

### So now how does AWS do it? 

When you use AWS environment variables, however, you're setting these variables in the context of the AWS service that runs your application. This might be an Elastic Beanstalk application environment, a Lambda function configuration, or an EC2 instance. 

When you set an environment variable in AWS, it's stored securely on the AWS side, and it's made available to your application when it's run in that environment. AWS ensures these variables are securely stored, managed, and passed to the runtime environment when your application is run.

Moreover, in AWS, these variables are defined on the service configuration level and can be used across different instances of your application. If your application scales and AWS starts more instances of your application to handle the load, these new instances would also have access to the environment variables defined in the service configuration.

In summary, the main difference between the two approaches is the scope and lifetime of the environment variables. With `dotenv`, environment variables are set per process on your local machine. With AWS environment variables, they're set per application or service, and are managed and stored securely by AWS on their servers. The environment variables are then made available to your application when it's run in the AWS environment, regardless of the scale or number of instances.
