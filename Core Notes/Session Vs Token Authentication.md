## Differences Between Session and Token Authentication

- **Storage**: Session IDs are stored server-side, while tokens are typically stored client-side.
- **State**: Sessions are stateful (server remembers the user), whereas tokens are stateless (server does not keep user data between requests).
- **Scalability**: Token-based authentication scales better due to its stateless nature, reducing server memory usage.
- **Security**: While both methods have robust security features, tokens can offer better control, as they can be designed to contain specific claims or permissions.
- **Usage**: Sessions are commonly used in traditional web applications, while tokens are favored in APIs, mobile applications, and Single Page Applications (SPAs).
