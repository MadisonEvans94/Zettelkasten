The `setdefault` method on a dictionary will:

1. Return the value for a specified key if the key is in the dictionary.
2. If the key is not in the dictionary, insert the key with the specified value (the second argument to `setdefault`) and return that value.

In the context of your Sudoku validator, `setdefault` is used to ensure that there is a set associated with a particular row, column, or sub-square. If one doesn't exist, it creates a new set for that key.

Here's an example to illustrate `setdefault`:

```python
d = {}
d.setdefault('key', set()).add('value')

print(d)
# Output: {'key': {'value'}}
```

In this example, `'key'` wasn't in the dictionary `d`, so `setdefault` added `'key'` to `d` with a new set as its value, and then `'value'` was added to this set.

Applied to your Sudoku code, `setdefault` is used to initialize the sets for rows, columns, and squares on-the-fly as they are needed, and then the current cell's value is added to these sets. This is done to track the numbers that have been seen in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid and ensure that no number is repeated within these.

Here is the corrected snippet from your code using `setdefault`:

```python
# Initialize the sets for rows, columns, and squares if not already present
rowMap.setdefault(r, set())
colMap.setdefault(c, set())
sqrMap.setdefault((r // 3, c // 3), set())

# Now you can safely add the current cell's value to these sets
```

Each time `setdefault` is called, it either gets the existing set for the row, column, or sub-square, or creates a new set if it hasn't been created yet. This prevents a `KeyError` and allows for the sets to be updated safely.
