Your questions touch on some crucial aspects of message queue implementation and client-server interaction in asynchronous processing. Let's delve into each part:

### Message Structure and State
1. **Message Content**: A message typically contains:
   - **Data**: The information needed to process the request. This could be identifiers, parameters, or even serialized objects.
   - **Metadata**: Information about the message, like timestamps, message ID, priority, etc.

2. **State and Reference to Client**:
   - Messages don't inherently store client state. They are usually stateless.
   - The state or reference to the client is included in the message data. For example, if a client's request needs processing, the message might include a user ID or request ID.
   - This data is used by the consumer (the service processing the message) to perform the task and know which client or request it relates to.

### Passing Messages
1. **In a Flask Application**: When a client makes a POST request, the Flask server creates a message with relevant data from the request.
2. **Queue Interaction**:
   - This message is sent to the message queue.
   - The server then immediately responds to the client (if synchronous) or keeps the connection open (if asynchronous).

### Handling Asynchronous Responses
1. **Returning a 'Promise'**: 
   - In the context of HTTP and Flask, you don't typically return an actual 'Promise' like in JavaScript. Instead, you may return a temporary response (like an acknowledgment or a task ID) or use long polling/WebSockets for keeping the connection open.

2. **Notifying the Client Upon Completion**:
   - **Polling**: The client regularly checks back with the server to see if the task is complete.
   - **Callback**: The client provides a callback URL or endpoint, which the server hits when the task is complete.
   - **WebSockets**: Maintain a persistent connection with the client to push the result once available.
   - **Webhooks**: Similar to callbacks, where the server triggers an action on a specified client endpoint upon task completion.

3. **Result Retrieval**:
   - If using a temporary response, this typically includes a task ID or similar identifier.
   - The client uses this ID to poll an endpoint on your server to check if the task is complete and retrieve the result.

### Example Flow in Flask
1. **Client POST Request**: Includes data needed for processing.
2. **Flask Server**: Receives request, creates a message, sends it to the queue, and responds with a task ID.
3. **Message Queue**: Holds the message until a worker picks it up.
4. **Worker**: Processes the message, then updates the task status (and possibly the result) in a database or cache.
5. **Client**: Polls a specific endpoint with the task ID to check the status. Once complete, the result is retrieved.

This flow ensures the Flask server remains responsive and doesnâ€™t get bogged down with lengthy processing tasks. The message queue acts as a buffer and a mechanism to decouple the request intake from the processing workload.

Does this help clarify how message queues function in terms of implementation and client-server interaction? If you have further questions or need more details on any part, feel free to ask!
