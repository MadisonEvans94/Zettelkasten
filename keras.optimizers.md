The `optimizers` module in Keras contains methods for different types of optimization algorithms which you can use to train your machine learning models. An optimizer is one of the two arguments required for compiling a Keras model.

Here is a quick summary of some of the more commonly used optimizers in Keras:

1.  **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**: This is a variant of gradient descent. In regular gradient descent, we would need to compute the gradient over the entire dataset to perform a single update, which isn't practical for large datasets. SGD instead performs the update for each training example. `SGD` in Keras also includes support for momentum.
    
2.  **RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation)**: This is an optimizer that utilizes the magnitude of the recent gradient descents to normalize the gradients. We move more slowly along steeper slopes and faster along shallower slopes. This optimizer is usually a good choice for recurrent neural networks.
    
3.  **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**: This combines the best properties of AdaGrad and RMSProp algorithms to provide an optimization algorithm that can handle sparse gradients and noisy data.
    
4.  **Adagrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm)**: This algorithm individually adapts the learning rates of all model parameters by scaling them inversely proportional to the square root of the sum of all their historical squared values.
    
5.  **Adadelta**: This is an extension of Adagrad that seeks to reduce its aggressive, monotonically reducing learning rate.
    
6.  **Adamax**: It is a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.
    
7.  **Nadam (Nesterov Adam optimizer)**: This is Adam RMSprop with Nesterov momentum.
    
8.  **Ftrl (Follow The Regularized Leader)**: This is an optimizer that implements the FTRL algorithm.
    

Each of these classes in `tensorflow.keras.optimizers` can take arguments such as the learning rate, momentum (for some optimizers), decay factor, etc.

Here is an example of using the Adam optimizer:

```python 
from tensorflow.keras import models, layers, optimizers

# Define the model
model = models.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)))
model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Create an optimizer with the desired parameters
opt = optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=opt, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

```

Choosing the right optimizer is a crucial part of training your model effectively. Different optimizers may perform better or worse depending on the specific characteristics of your data and model. While Adam is a good general-purpose optimizer to start with, you should consider testing multiple optimizers to see what works best for your specific task.
