## Intuition From a Deep Learning Context 


The $( \tanh )$ function (hyperbolic tangent) plays a pivotal role in RNNs and many other neural network architectures. Let's delve into its characteristics and intuitions:

1. **Range between -1 and 1:** Unlike the sigmoid function which outputs values between 0 and 1, the $( \tanh )$ function outputs values between -1 and 1. This centralizing feature means that the average of its output is closer to 0, which can help in centering the data and potentially lead to faster convergence during training.

2. **Squashing/Compression:** The $( \tanh )$ function is a squashing function, which means regardless of the input value (whether very large or very small), the output will always be between -1 and 1. This property is especially useful for RNNs where repeated multiplications can cause values to explode or vanish. The squashing effect can mitigate the exploding values problem to some extent.

3. **Non-linearity:** Neural networks leverage activation functions to introduce non-linearity. Without non-linear activation functions, no matter how deep the network is, it would behave just like a linear model. The $( \tanh )$ function provides this necessary non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.

4. **Derivative's Range:** The derivative of the $( \tanh )$ function lies between 0 and 1. This is useful for backpropagation, where we use the derivative to adjust the weights.

5. **Historical Context:** Historically, before the widespread use of the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function, sigmoid and $( \tanh )$ were the most commonly used activation functions. $( \tanh )$ was preferred over sigmoid in many cases because of its zero-centered output.

6. **Analogy:** Think of the $( \tanh )$ function as a kind of "soft limiter." Imagine you're a musician and you're amplifying an audio signal. If the signal becomes too loud (or too soft), it could become distorted or lost. A limiter ensures that the signal stays within a particular range. Similarly, the $( \tanh )$ function ensures that the activations in the RNN don't get too extreme.

In the context of RNNs, the $( \tanh )$ function acts as a regularizing mechanism, preventing the activations from reaching extremely high or low values. This can be particularly important given the recurrent nature of these networks, where activations can be fed back into the network multiple times.


> why tanh and not sigmoid?

Both the \( \tanh \) and sigmoid functions have been widely used as activation functions in neural networks, especially in early architectures. However, there are several reasons why \( \tanh \) is often preferred over sigmoid in the context of RNNs and certain other neural structures:

1. **Zero-Centered Output:** One of the main advantages of \( \tanh \) over sigmoid is that it produces outputs in the range of [-1, 1], meaning its output is zero-centered. In contrast, the sigmoid function produces outputs in the range [0, 1], which are not zero-centered. Having outputs that are centered around zero can make learning easier and lead to faster convergence, since the gradients have consistent signs, avoiding potential issues where weights oscillate during updates.

2. **Gradient Strength:** The gradients for values closer to 0 are stronger for \( \tanh \) compared to sigmoid. This can help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, which is a particular concern for RNNs due to their sequential nature.

3. **Historical Usage and Empirical Results:** In the earlier days of neural networks, before more modern activation functions like ReLU became widespread, both sigmoid and \( \tanh \) were popular choices. Empirical results from experiments often showed \( \tanh \) to perform better than sigmoid in hidden layers of neural networks, leading to a preference for \( \tanh \).

4. **Saturation Dynamics:** Both \( \tanh \) and sigmoid can saturate, but the saturation dynamics of \( \tanh \) (given its zero-centered nature) can be more favorable for learning in certain architectures, especially in the hidden layers.

5. **Interpretability in Some Contexts:** In certain applications, having an output that can be negative (like with \( \tanh \)) can be more interpretable than a strictly positive output (like with sigmoid). For instance, in the case of sentiment analysis, a negative value might be associated with a negative sentiment, a positive value with a positive sentiment, and values close to zero indicating neutrality.

However, it's worth noting that neither $( \tanh )$ nor sigmoid is the definitive best choice for all scenarios. The choice of activation function can often depend on the specific problem being addressed, the architecture of the neural network, and other factors. For instance, in the output layer of a binary classification problem, a sigmoid activation is often preferred because it produces probabilities between 0 and 1. But for hidden layers, especially in RNNs, $( \tanh )$ has often been found to be more effective.
