# Zettelkasten Mind Map for Software Engineering

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a dynamic, evolving knowledge base that encapsulates a wide array of topics in software engineering. The Zettelkasten method is employed to create a graph-like structure of interconnected notes, each serving as a node that links to one or more "upstream" concepts. This enables a holistic understanding of the subject matter, facilitating both depth and breadth of knowledge.

## Summary of Contents

The repository covers a multitude of topics in software engineering, organized into various domains:

- **Machine Learning**: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks, etc.
- **Distributed Systems**: CAP theorem, Microservices, Load Balancing, etc.
- **Frontend Development**: React, Vue, CSS Preprocessors, Webpack, etc.
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Sorting, Searching, Trees, Graphs, etc.
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Django, Flask, TensorFlow, etc.
- **Software Development Best Practices**: SOLID principles, TDD, CI/CD, etc.
- **Audio Engineering**: DSP algorithms, Audio codecs, etc.
- **And More**: DevOps, Security, Databases, etc.
