### Description: 

In the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a kernel, also known as a filter, is a small matrix of weights. These weights are learned during the training process of the network. The kernel is used to perform the convolution operation across the input image or the preceding layer's feature maps.


### Underlying Question: 
- Is there a non-mathematical way to think about this? 

### Reasoning: 

**Flashlight Analogy**

Imagine you have a flashlight that can only light up a small part of a dark room at a time. This flashlight is like the kernel, and the room is like your image. As you move your flashlight across the room (slide the kernel across the image), you can see different parts of the room (different parts of the image).

The kernel is a matrix of weights that determines what features from the image or preceding layer the network should pay attention to. For instance, some kernels may be better at detecting edges, while others might be good at picking up textures or colors. The kernels are trained to learn these weights that can best help the model to achieve its objective, like classifying images.

The kernel size is an important parameter and determines the field of view for the convolution operation. Common kernel sizes include 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7, although these can be adjusted depending on the specific requirements of the model. In most cases, multiple kernels are used to allow the network to learn to detect multiple features.

The learned feature maps that result from the convolution operation (applying the kernel to the input image or feature map) are then passed through an activation function, like the [[ReLU]], and used as input for the next layer of the network.

Remember, the terms "kernel", "filter", and sometimes "neuron" are often used interchangeably when discussing convolutional neural networks.
