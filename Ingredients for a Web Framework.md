### Core Functionalities for Most Frameworks 

*This includes frameworks such as Django, Ruby on Rails, Express, and Flask just to name a few...*

These eight points encompass the core functionalities of many web development frameworks, including both frontend and backend frameworks.

1.  **MVC Architecture**: This is a common design pattern that separates application logic into three interconnected components. This separation facilitates code organization, scalability, and maintainability. see [[Model View Controller (MVC)]] for more
    
2.  **Routing**: Any web framework should have the ability to define routes that map to specific application functions. This allows the application to respond appropriately to client requests. see [[Routing in Web Development]] for more
    
3.  **Middleware**: Middleware provides a way to insert modular functionality into the request-response cycle. It can be used for logging, error handling, parsing requests, authentication, and more. see [[Middleware]] for more
    
4.  **Object Relational Mapping (ORM)**: An ORM allows the application to interact with a database using the object-oriented paradigm. This abstracts away much of the complexity of database queries, improving development speed and efficiency. see [[Object Relational Mapping (ORM)]]
    
5.  **Templating Engines**: Templating engines facilitate the generation of dynamic HTML content. While this is more relevant for full-stack and frontend frameworks, even backend frameworks might make use of this for server-side rendering. see [[Server-side Rendering (SSR)]] for more
    
6.  **Security Practices**: Security is a crucial concern for any web application. A good framework should provide utilities for protecting against common threats like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), etc. see [[Common Web Security Threats]] for more
    
7.  **Testing**: Support for testing is a critical feature of modern web frameworks. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests help ensure the application behaves as expected and helps to prevent bugs.
    
8.  **Deployment**: While not a direct feature of the framework, ease of deployment on various platforms is a key consideration for many development teams. A good framework will have straightforward methods for packaging and deploying the application.
    

Remember, these features and facilities can vary from one framework to another based on the framework's design philosophy, its intended use cases, and the language it's written in. However, these eight points are commonly addressed in many of the most popular web development frameworks.
