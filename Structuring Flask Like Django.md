To structure a Flask application more similarly to Django's app-centric design, you would create distinct modules (akin to Django apps) that encapsulate specific functionalities or features of your application. Each module would contain its own models, views (or controllers), templates (if applicable), and forms. Here's how you can organize such a structure:

### Project Structure

Suppose your project is named `MyFlaskProject`. The directory structure could be as follows:

```
MyFlaskProject/
│
├── app1/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── routes.py
│   ├── services.py
│   ├── forms.py
│   └── templates/
│       └── ...
│
├── app2/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── routes.py
│   ├── services.py
│   ├── forms.py
│   └── templates/
│       └── ...
│
├── static/
│   └── ...
│
├── templates/
│   └── ...
│
├── config.py
├── main.py
└── requirements.txt
```

### Breakdown of Components

- **App Modules (`app1`, `app2`, etc.)**: Each 'app' is a Python package that encapsulates a specific feature or component of your application. For example, `app1` could be a user authentication system, while `app2` could be a blog.
  
- **Models (`models.py`)**: Similar to Django, each app would have its own `models.py` file, defining database models related to that app's functionality.

- **Routes (`routes.py`)**: This file would contain route definitions and view functions specific to the app. It's similar to Django's `views.py`, but in Flask, it also includes URL routing.

- **Services (`services.py`)**: This file can contain business logic, similar to service classes you already have.

- **Forms (`forms.py`)**: If your app deals with form processing, this file would contain Flask-WTF form classes.

- **Templates**: Flask doesn't have a concept of app-specific templates like Django, but you can structure your templates directory within each app for organization.

- **Main Application File (`main.py`)**: This file would create and configure the Flask application object, register blueprints from each app, and set up other configurations like database and migrations.

### Main Application Setup (`main.py`)

```python
from flask import Flask
from app1 import app1_bp
from app2 import app2_bp
# other imports...

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object('config.DevelopmentConfig')

# Register Blueprints
app.register_blueprint(app1_bp, url_prefix='/app1')
app.register_blueprint(app2_bp, url_prefix='/app2')

# Additional setup...
```

### App Initialization (`__init__.py` in each app)

In each app's `__init__.py`, you would set up the blueprint.

```python
from flask import Blueprint

app1_bp = Blueprint('app1', __name__)

from . import routes
```

### Advantages and Considerations

- **Modularity**: This structure promotes modularity and separation of concerns. Each app is self-contained with its own models, routes, and business logic.
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale and maintain, especially for large projects with multiple distinct components.
- **Template Management**: Flask doesn't enforce app-specific templates, so managing templates might require additional considerations.
- **Django vs Flask Paradigms**: It's important to remember that Flask is more flexible and less opinionated than Django, so while this structure mimics Django's, Flask's inherent flexibility allows for variations based on project needs.

Remember, while Flask allows for this kind of structure, it doesn't enforce it. The best structure for your project might depend on your specific requirements, the size and scope of your application, and your development team's preferences.
