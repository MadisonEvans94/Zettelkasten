## What is a CNAME Record?

**CNAME** records are DNS records used to create aliases for domain names. They are used to point a domain or subdomain to another domain name. This means, when someone tries to access a CNAME record, the DNS will point them to the true domain name, or the canonical domain name.

## Anatomy of a CNAME Record

A CNAME record consists of two main parts:

### Alias Name 
This is the domain or subdomain that you want to create an alias for. For instance, in the case of `_a9376a425663ef152dd6d1ea926aa10f.palettepalapp.com`...
***`_a9376a425663ef152dd6d1ea926aa10f`*** is the alias.

### Canonical Name
This is the true or actual domain where the alias points to. This can be any valid domain name.

- [x] what is meant by *valid domain name*? Do you mean a domain name that is purchased? Are you implying that a purchased domain name gets stored somewhere? What's preventing me from just putting an already active domain name such as "facebook.com" as my canonical name? 

Good questions! Here's an attempt to address them:

1. **Valid domain name**: A valid domain name is one that conforms to the standards set by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This means it follows the character rules (letters, numbers, hyphens), length rules (1-63 characters for each label, and the total length, including the top-level domain, doesn't exceed 253 characters), and is unique across the internet. This doesn't necessarily mean it's purchased. It could be a free subdomain provided by a hosting service, for example.

2. **Purchased domain name**: When you purchase a domain name, you're essentially buying the rights to use that specific address on the internet for a set period of time. This doesn't mean you 'own' the domain in the traditional sense - you're more leasing the rights to use it. 

3. **Storage of domain names**: Domain names are stored in a domain name registry, which is a database of all domain names registered in each Top Level Domain (TLD) like .com, .org, .net. The registry operator keeps the master database of information and also generates the zone file that allows computers to route internet traffic to and from top-level domains anywhere in the world. 

4. **Using "facebook.com" as a canonical name**: While you technically can enter "facebook.com" as a canonical name in your DNS settings, it wouldn't achieve much. CNAME records are used to alias one name to another. If you created a CNAME record with "facebook.com" as the canonical name, it would just mean that anyone trying to access your domain would end up at Facebook. However, you wouldn't be able to control or manipulate Facebook's content, so this would generally not be a useful thing to do. Furthermore, modern browsers and the HTTPS protocol may block such attempts due to security mechanisms that protect against this type of misdirection. 

I hope that clears things up! Let me know if you have more questions.

## The "Random" Letters in a CNAME Record

The "random" letters and numbers in your AWS-issued CNAME record (_a9376a425663ef152dd6d1ea926aa10f.palettepalapp.com) aren't really random. They are generated by AWS and used as a unique identifier for validating that you have control over your domain.

When you apply for an SSL certificate with AWS, it generates a unique CNAME record for you to add to your DNS configuration. This CNAME record helps AWS confirm that you have control over your domain. 


AWS Certificate Manager issues you this unique CNAME record so you can validate your domain. In your case, "_a9376a425663ef152dd6d1ea926aa10f" is a unique identifier created by AWS. You have to add this record to your DNS configuration (in Google Domains, in your case). 

Once AWS sees that this unique record exists in your DNS settings, it understands that you control the domain and proceeds to issue the certificate.

## How to add a CNAME record in Google Domains

To add a CNAME record to your Google Domains configuration, follow these steps:

1. Go to Google Domains and sign in.
2. Select your domain.
3. Open the menu if it isn't already open.
4. Click on DNS.
5. Scroll down to the Custom resource records section.
6. In the first field under "Name", enter the alias provided by AWS (in your case, "_a9376a425663ef152dd6d1ea926aa10f").
7. In the dropdown menu for "Type", select "CNAME".
8. In the "Data" field, enter the domain that AWS provided (this is typically a longer domain name, similar to a standard AWS-generated domain).
9. Click on the "Add" button.

After you have added the CNAME record, it may take some time for the changes to propagate through the internet's DNS system. Once propagation is complete, AWS should be able to see the CNAME record and validate your domain for the SSL certificate.

I hope this document clarifies CNAME records for you! Let me know if there's anything else you want to know about.
