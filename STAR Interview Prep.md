## Intel Projects and responsibilities

### Stanchion
##### Summary: 
During my tenure at Intel as a Mechanical Engineer, I spearheaded a complex stanchion production project. The initiative involved a ground-up design of custom clean room stanchions, which were crafted in-house. Leading a team of dedicated engineers, I played a pivotal role in the design of all components, the creation of the Bill of Materials (BOM), and sourcing of the required materials. I worked closely with machinists to translate our design into reality. We faced significant challenges in crafting a product that was both sturdy and cost-effective. One particularly demanding task was designing a unique cam follower system for the base piece of the stanchion to accommodate all potential floor tiles in the cleanroom fabrication. Ultimately, our efforts led to a 30% reduction in assembly costs and significant improvements in ergonomic conditions for our technicians.

**Describe a time when you had to work on a project under a tight deadline.**
- New fabs were going up and we needed them beforehand
- Lots of materials with different lead times (*answer how we managed and planed timing for it all, look up time management tools*)

### 3D Print of Handles
##### Summary: 
In another key project at Intel, I was tasked with the complete redesign of handles for a lid component used within the fabrication facility. The original handles were overly heavy, failing to meet our safety and ergonomic standards. My challenge was to significantly reduce the weight of these handles without sacrificing their structural integrity. To achieve this, I started by performing a 3D scan of the original part. I then used SolidWorks to redesign the handle, taking advantage of its advanced features to optimize the design for our specific needs. The redesigned handles were printed using a carbon fiber printer to maintain high strength while reducing weight. I also utilized advanced mathematical principles to conduct Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on the 3D printed parts. This ensured a sufficient factor of safety was maintained in the final product, balancing the dual needs of lightweight design and structural integrity.

**Describe a time when you had to explain a complex technical issue to a non-technical person.**
- Justification for using carbon fiber for the handles 


### Roll Cams
##### Summary: 
**Describe a situation when you had a conflict with a team member. How did you resolve it?**
- There was no ware on the inner diameter and the fault lied somewhere else 
- super expensive to make in house 

### Machine Shop prioritization
##### Summary: 
**Describe a project where you had to learn new technology**
- Sci-kit learn 
*Look up what types of plots are useful for this type of data analysis*

### BCL removal tool
##### Summary: 
**Can you provide an example of a project where the requirements changed midway? How did you handle it?**
- Had to come in from the bottom instead of the top due to the fragileness of the coating 
*Look up what tools you use for design ideation*

### Spin chuck 2.0
##### Summary: 
**Can you provide an example of when you went above and beyond for a project or client?**
- Developed mutliple design concepts and took a prototype through costing and everything 

### Leak Check
##### Summary: 
**Describe a situation where you had to balance multiple projects at the same time. How did you prioritize?**
- Needed to get leak check in in time for quarter closure amidst all my other projects 
*look up project management tools*

### Pad Line

#### Failure with Ireland DOE
##### Summary: 
**Tell me about a time when you made a significant mistake during a project. How did you handle it?**
- Bad communication on deliverables 
- developed a DOE and took charge of spearheading meetings 
*look up stuff for DOE*

#### Sensor
##### Summary: 
**Tell me about a time when you proactively identified a potential problem and solved it before it became a major issue.**
- Noticed the quality was going bad for adhesive 
- identified a solution that helped add a level of security 
*look up exactly what keyence hardware and software was used and how it works*

## Personal Projects

### Palette Pal 
**Tell me about a project that you are particularly proud of. Why was it successful?**
- got to combine a bunch of different domain knowledges together into a working product 

### Blue Cloud Music 

### DuoTune 
**Tell me about a time when you had to learn a new technology or language for a project.**
- flask 
- RDS, elastic beanstalk (ongoing transition)
*be sure to know all about RDS and elastic beanstalk*

## GT Projects 

### Android Project 
**Tell me about a time when you had to learn a new technology or language for a project.**
*be sure to know how gradle and xml work*

### ML Projects
