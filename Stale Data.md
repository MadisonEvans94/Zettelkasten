### Definition: 

In simple terms, **stale data** refers to information or data that is outdated or no longer reflects the most recent or accurate state of the system. Stale data can occur when there is a delay in updating or propagating changes to all relevant parts of a system or when the data has not been refreshed to reflect the latest updates or modifications.

Think of stale data as data that has expired or become obsolete because newer or more recent updates or changes have occurred. It is data that does not represent the current or real-time state of the system or the most recent information available.

*For example...*, let's say that a client makes a patch request to a certain piece of data and the database successfully updates. If a different client is shown the older data instead of the most recent update, then that user's data is **stale**

Stale data can be problematic because it may lead to inconsistencies or incorrect results when relying on outdated information. It is important for systems to ensure that data is kept up-to-date and that users or applications have access to the most recent and accurate data to make informed decisions or perform reliable operations.
