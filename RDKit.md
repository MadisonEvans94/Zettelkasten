# Introduction to RDKit

## Overview

RDKit is an open-source toolkit for [[Cheminformatics]]. It's widely used in the field of computational chemistry for processing and analyzing chemical information.

## Key Features

- **Molecular Processing**: Handles various aspects of molecular structures, from simple representation to complex manipulations.
- **Chemical Reactions**: Facilitates the analysis and simulation of chemical reactions.
- **Data Analysis**: Offers tools for data handling related to chemical compounds.
- **Molecular Visualization**: Supports 2D and 3D rendering of molecular structures.
- **Fingerprint Generation**: Enables the creation of molecular fingerprints, useful in similarity searches and other analyses.

## Applications

RDKit is commonly used in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research for tasks such as structure-activity relationship analysis and molecular screening.

## Getting Started

### Installation

RDKit can be installed via conda: `conda install -c conda-forge rdkit`

### Basic Usage

```python
from rdkit import Chem
molecule = Chem.MolFromSmiles('C1=CC=CC=C1')  # Example for creating a molecule from SMILES
print(molecule.GetNumAtoms())  # Outputs the number of atoms in the molecule
```
