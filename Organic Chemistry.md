# Organic Chemistry

## Overview

Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and synthesis of organic compounds, which contain carbon in covalent bonding. The discipline encompasses a wide variety of substances, including compounds that are essential to life, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates, as well as industrial products like plastics and pharmaceuticals.
